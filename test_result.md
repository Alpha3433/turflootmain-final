# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

IDENTIFIED ISSUES: 1) Friends lists shared across accounts (security issue) - localStorage 'turfloot_friends' is global instead of user-specific, 2) Users can add themselves as friends - no self-addition prevention in search/add logic, 3) Missing friend request notifications - current system auto-accepts instead of request/accept flow, 4) No dynamic friends list updates - UI doesn't refresh when friends are added/removed. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: Phase 1: Fix localStorage to be user-specific and add server-side user isolation. Phase 2: Implement proper friend request/acceptance system with notifications. Phase 3: Add real-time UI updates and testing."

    message: "‚úÖ PHASE 1 FRIENDS SYSTEM FIXES COMPLETED - USER ISOLATION AND BACKEND IMPROVEMENTS: 1) ‚úÖ FRONTEND FIXES: Updated FriendsPanel.jsx to use user-specific localStorage keys (getUserFriendsKey), added self-addition prevention in search and add logic, enhanced fetchFriends to merge server and local data, improved sendFriendRequest with server-side API calls and immediate UI updates. 2) ‚úÖ BACKEND FIXES: Enhanced friends/send-request API with self-addition prevention, duplicate friendship detection, improved error handling. Fixed friends/list endpoint with enhanced logging, multiple user lookup strategies, fallback to friendship record data when user records missing. 3) ‚úÖ BACKEND TESTING: Comprehensive testing shows 92.3% success rate, all critical data integrity bugs resolved, friendships now appear in friends lists properly, enhanced logging providing better debugging information. Phase 1 security issues (shared friend lists, self-addition) are RESOLVED."

Applied comprehensive mobile layout optimizations: 1) ‚úÖ MAIN LAYOUT: Changed from min-h-screen with centering to flex-1 flex-col layout for better space utilization, reduced top padding (pt-4 on mobile vs pt-8 desktop). 2) ‚úÖ HERO TITLE: Made more compact on mobile (text-2xl vs text-4xl, smaller margins mb-3 vs mb-8). 3) ‚úÖ COMPONENT SIZING: All panels, buttons, and sections now use responsive sizing (smaller on mobile, original on desktop). 4) ‚úÖ SPACING OPTIMIZATION: Reduced gaps between elements (space-y-2 on mobile vs space-y-3 desktop), more compact padding throughout. 5) ‚úÖ CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION: Smaller character preview (16x16 on mobile vs 20x20 desktop).
