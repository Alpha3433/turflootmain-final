# Production Deployment Fix Guide for https://turfloot.com/

## üö® ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**Problem**: https://turfloot.com/ keeps loading after deployment due to client-side rendering bailout.

**Root Cause**: Production deployment is using corrupted/incompatible build files causing Next.js to fail during SSR and fallback to CSR (Client-Side Rendering), but the client-side JavaScript isn't executing properly.

**Evidence**:
- HTML loads correctly (HTTP 200)
- Shows `<template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template>`
- Content hidden with `<div style="visibility:hidden"></div>`
- Static assets accessible but application doesn't render

## üîß PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION

### **Option 1: Quick Fix - Redeploy Clean Build**

#### **Step 1: Access Production Server/Container**
```bash
# SSH into your production server or access the deployment environment
# This depends on your infrastructure (Kubernetes, Docker, etc.)
```

#### **Step 2: Clear Corrupted Build**
```bash
# Navigate to application directory
cd /path/to/turfloot

# Remove corrupted build files
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules/.cache

# Clear any cached data
yarn cache clean
```

#### **Step 3: Fresh Production Build**
```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
yarn install

# Create fresh production build
NODE_ENV=production yarn build

# Verify build completed successfully
ls -la .next/
```

#### **Step 4: Restart Production Services**
```bash
# For Docker containers:
docker restart turfloot-container

# For Kubernetes:
kubectl rollout restart deployment turfloot-deployment

# For PM2/Supervisor:
pm2 restart turfloot
# OR
supervisorctl restart turfloot

# For systemd:
systemctl restart turfloot
```

### **Option 2: Deploy Working Local Build**

Since our local development is working perfectly, you can deploy the exact same configuration:

#### **Step 1: Create Production-Ready Build Locally**
```bash
# In your local working directory (/app)
cd /app

# Clear any existing build
rm -rf .next

# Create fresh production build
NODE_ENV=production yarn build

# Verify the build works locally
yarn start
# Test: http://localhost:3000 should work perfectly
```

#### **Step 2: Package for Production Deployment**
```bash
# Create deployment package
tar -czf turfloot-production.tar.gz \
    .next/ \
    node_modules/ \
    package.json \
    next.config.js \
    app/ \
    components/ \
    lib/ \
    .env.production

# Transfer to production server
scp turfloot-production.tar.gz user@production-server:/path/to/deploy/
```

#### **Step 3: Deploy on Production**
```bash
# On production server
cd /path/to/turfloot
tar -xzf turfloot-production.tar.gz

# Start production server
NODE_ENV=production yarn start
```

## üéØ ALTERNATIVE APPROACH: Use Development Mode in Production

**If production builds continue to fail, temporarily use development mode:**

### **Step 1: Update Production Configuration**
```bash
# On production server, update your process manager config

# For Supervisor (/etc/supervisor/conf.d/turfloot.conf):
[program:turfloot]
command = yarn dev
directory = /app
environment = NODE_ENV="development",HOST="0.0.0.0",PORT="3000"
autostart = true
autorestart = true

# For PM2:
pm2 start "yarn dev" --name turfloot

# For Docker (update Dockerfile):
CMD ["yarn", "dev"]
```

### **Step 2: Restart Production Services**
```bash
# Restart with development mode
supervisorctl restart turfloot
# OR your relevant restart command
```

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS

### **Step 1: Verify Static Assets**
```bash
# Check if CSS files are accessible
curl -I https://turfloot.com/_next/static/css/4e1bff196bcbfce8.css

# Check if JavaScript chunks are accessible  
curl -I https://turfloot.com/_next/static/chunks/main-app-f9a1d4e8e65f8b84.js

# All should return HTTP 200
```

### **Step 2: Check Browser Console**
1. Open https://turfloot.com/ in browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Check Console tab for JavaScript errors
4. Look for 404 errors or JavaScript execution failures

### **Step 3: Verify Environment Variables**
```bash
# On production server, verify environment variables
echo $NODE_ENV
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL
echo $MONGO_URL

# Should show production values
```

### **Step 4: Test API Endpoints**
```bash
# Test if backend APIs are working
curl https://turfloot.com/api/users/profile/update-name \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"test","customName":"test","privyId":"test","email":null}'

# Should return 200 with success response
```

## üìã DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### **Pre-Deployment:**
- [ ] Local development working perfectly
- [ ] Fresh `yarn build` completes without errors
- [ ] `yarn start` works locally with production build
- [ ] All environment variables configured correctly
- [ ] Database connectivity verified

### **During Deployment:**
- [ ] Clear all cached/corrupted build files
- [ ] Fresh dependency installation (`yarn install`)
- [ ] Successful production build (`yarn build`)
- [ ] Verify static assets generated in `.next/static/`
- [ ] Start production server (`yarn start`)

### **Post-Deployment:**
- [ ] Site loads completely (not just HTML)
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Name change functionality works
- [ ] All navigation and features operational

---

## üéØ EXPECTED RESULTS

### **‚úÖ After Successful Deployment:**
- https://turfloot.com/ loads complete TurfLoot interface
- No infinite loading or blank screens
- All buttons, navigation, and features work
- Name changes save and persist correctly
- Console shows no critical JavaScript errors
- Application performs identically to local development

### **üîç Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Quick verification test
curl -s https://turfloot.com/ | grep -i "turfloot" 

# API functionality test
curl -X POST https://turfloot.com/api/users/profile/update-name \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"test-prod","customName":"ProductionTest","privyId":"test-prod","email":"test@prod.com"}' \
  | jq .

# Should return: {"success":true, ...}
```

## üöÄ RECOMMENDED DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

**Best Approach for Immediate Resolution:**

1. **Quick Fix**: Use development mode in production temporarily
   - Fastest resolution
   - Identical to working local environment
   - Allows immediate functionality

2. **Proper Fix**: Create fresh production build from working local code
   - Long-term solution
   - Better performance
   - Production-optimized

3. **Monitoring**: Set up deployment verification
   - Automated health checks
   - Build verification tests
   - Rollback procedures

---

## üí° PREVENTION FOR FUTURE DEPLOYMENTS

### **Build Verification Pipeline:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# build-and-verify.sh

echo "Starting production build verification..."

# Clean build
rm -rf .next
yarn build || exit 1

# Test production build locally
yarn start &
PID=$!
sleep 10

# Verify application responds
curl -f http://localhost:3000/ || {
    kill $PID
    echo "‚ùå Production build verification failed"
    exit 1
}

kill $PID
echo "‚úÖ Production build verified successfully"
```
