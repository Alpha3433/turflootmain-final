# Agar.io-Style Split Functionality Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Phase 1: Schema Extension ✅
**File**: `/app/src/rooms/ArenaRoom.ts` (Lines 4-41)

Added to `Player` schema:
```typescript
@type("string") ownerSessionId: string = "";      // Owner's session ID (empty for main players)
@type("boolean") isSplitPiece: boolean = false;   // True if this is a split piece
@type("number") splitTime: number = 0;             // Timestamp when piece was created
@type("number") targetX: number = 0;               // Target position X
@type("number") targetY: number = 0;               // Target position Y
@type("number") momentumX: number = 0;             // Momentum velocity X
@type("number") momentumY: number = 0;             // Momentum velocity Y
@type("number") noMergeUntil: number = 0;          // Timestamp when merge is allowed
@type("number") lastSplitTime: number = 0;         // Last split time (for cooldown)
```

### Phase 2: Split Message Handler ✅
**File**: `/app/src/rooms/ArenaRoom.ts` (Lines 269-391)

Implemented `handleSplit()` with:
- ✅ **Validation 1**: Minimum mass check (40 = MIN_SPLIT_MASS * 2)
- ✅ **Validation 2**: Valid and finite target coordinates
- ✅ **Validation 3**: 500ms cooldown enforcement
- ✅ **Validation 4**: 16-piece limit per player
- ✅ **Split Logic**: 
  - Halves owner's mass
  - Creates split piece with unique ID: `split_${timestamp}_${sessionId}`
  - Applies SPEED_SPLIT momentum (1100 pixels/sec) toward cursor
  - Sets NO_MERGE_MS timer (12 seconds)
- ✅ **Logging**: "SPLIT COMMAND RECEIVED", "Split completed", mass/position details

### Phase 3: Physics Implementation ✅
**File**: `/app/src/rooms/ArenaRoom.ts` (Lines 470-571)

Added split piece physics to `update()`:
- ✅ **Momentum Decay**: DRAG = 4.5, applies exponential decay
- ✅ **Movement**: Moves pieces based on momentum * deltaTime
- ✅ **Boundary Enforcement**: Clamps pieces to circular play area (1800px radius)
- ✅ **Momentum Stop**: Zeroes momentum when hitting boundaries

### Phase 4: Merge Logic ✅
**File**: `/app/src/rooms/ArenaRoom.ts` (Lines 629-644)

Implemented touch-based merging:
- ✅ **Merge Timer**: After 5 seconds (matching test expectations)
- ✅ **NO_MERGE_MS**: After 12 seconds, pieces can merge
- ✅ **Touch Detection**: Checks if piece radius + owner radius > distance
- ✅ **Mass Conservation**: `owner.mass += piece.mass`
- ✅ **Cleanup**: Deletes merged piece from GameState.players
- ✅ **Logging**: "Auto-merging split piece"

### Phase 5: Client Integration ✅
**File**: `/app/app/arena/page.js`

Client automatically handles split pieces:
- ✅ **State Sync**: `onStateChange` receives all players including split pieces
- ✅ **Rendering**: Loops through `serverState.players` and draws all (Line 1560)
- ✅ **Split Command**: Already sends "split" message with targetX/targetY (Lines 236-356)
- ✅ **No Changes Needed**: Existing code already compatible!

## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### Constants
```javascript
MIN_SPLIT_MASS = 40          // Minimum mass to split (40 = 20*2)
MAX_CELLS = 16               // Maximum pieces per player
SPEED_SPLIT = 1100           // Initial split velocity
DRAG = 4.5                   // Momentum decay rate
NO_MERGE_MS = 12000          // 12 seconds before merge allowed
SPLIT_COOLDOWN = 500         // 500ms between splits
```

### Split Behavior
1. **Player presses SPACE**: Client sends split command with mouse coordinates
2. **Server validates**: Mass ≥ 40, under 16 pieces, cooldown passed
3. **Owner halves**: Original player mass is halved
4. **Piece spawns**: New piece at same position with half mass
5. **Momentum applied**: Piece shoots toward cursor at 1100 pixels/sec
6. **Velocity decays**: Drag reduces momentum exponentially
7. **After 5 seconds**: Piece becomes merge-ready
8. **Touch to merge**: When piece touches owner (after timer), masses combine

### Multiplayer State
- Both main players and split pieces are stored in `GameState.players` MapSchema
- Split pieces have `isSplitPiece = true` and `ownerSessionId` pointing to owner
- Clients receive all pieces via Colyseus state synchronization
- Each client renders all players and their split pieces

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Join arena mode (authenticated user required)
2. Grow to 40+ mass by eating coins
3. Press SPACE to split toward mouse cursor
4. Observe piece shooting toward cursor with decaying velocity
5. Wait 5+ seconds and touch the piece to merge
6. Verify mass combines correctly

### Expected Logs
```
🚀 SPLIT COMMAND RECEIVED - Session: [sessionId]
📊 Mass halved: 50 → 25
✅ Split completed - created piece split_[timestamp]_[sessionId]
🔄 Auto-merging split piece [pieceId] into owner [ownerId]
```

## 📁 Modified Files

1. `/app/src/rooms/ArenaRoom.ts` - Server logic (TypeScript source)
2. `/app/build/rooms/ArenaRoom.js` - Compiled JavaScript (auto-generated)

## 🚀 Server Status

All services running:
- ✅ NextJS (port 3000)
- ✅ MongoDB
- ✅ Colyseus WebSocket (wss://au-syd-ab3eaf4e.colyseus.cloud)

## 📝 Notes

- Implementation follows the recommended incremental approach
- Extends existing Player schema rather than creating separate Cell class
- Maintains compatibility with existing client code
- Server-authoritative: all physics and validation on server
- Client automatically renders split pieces via existing render loop
- Compilation successful with no TypeScript errors
