Simplified Split Functionality Disconnection Prevention Test
Tests the specific changes made to prevent disconnections when pressing spacebar to split.

Review Request Focus:
- Simplified Player Schema (removed sessionId, ownerSessionId)
- Simplified Split Owner Tracking (extract from session ID string)
- Reduced Schema Complexity (only momentumX, momentumY, splitTime)
- Server stability during split operations
