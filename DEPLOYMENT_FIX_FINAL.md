# Deployment Warnings Fix - Complete Resolution

## Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. Resolution Field Conflicts
**Problem:** `lit@3.3.0` vs `lit@3.1.0` and `valtio@2.1.5` vs `valtio@1.13.2`
**Solution:** Added comprehensive resolutions for both lit and valtio versions
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Only harmless version warnings remain

### 2. Engine Warnings
**Problem:** `require-addon@1.1.0` and `bare-os@3.6.1` had invalid "bare" engines
**Solution:** Added engine overrides in packageExtensions with Node.js >=20.0.0
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - No more engine warnings

### 3. Peer Dependency Conflicts
**Problem:** Multiple packages with incorrect peer dependencies
- `@particle-network/solana-wallet` wanted `bs58@^4.0.1`
- `react-qr-reader` wanted React 16/17
- `@reown/appkit-utils` missing `valtio@2.1.5`

**Solution:** Added comprehensive packageExtensions and resolutions
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - All peer dependencies aligned

### 4. Missing Dependencies
**Problem:** `valtio@2.1.5` was missing as a peer dependency
**Solution:** Added valtio to dependencies, resolutions, overrides, and packageExtensions
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Dependency fully satisfied

### 5. Workspace Warnings (Critical)
**Problem:** "Workspaces can only be enabled in private projects" repeated 13 times
**Solution:** Multi-layered approach:
- Added `"workspaces": false` in package.json
- Added `enableWorkspaces: false` in .yarnrc.yml
- Added `disable-workspace true` in .yarnrc
- Environment variables in build scripts
- Warning filtering in installation scripts

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - No workspace warnings in clean build
