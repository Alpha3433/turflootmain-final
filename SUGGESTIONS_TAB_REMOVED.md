### 2. Function Removal

- **Removed**: All API calls to `/friends-api/suggestions`
- **Result**: No unnecessary API requests

### 3. Effect Cleanup

- **Result**: Faster component initialization

### 4. UI Component Removal

## ðŸ“Š **Before vs After**

### Before (4 Tabs):
```
[Friends] [Requests] [Search] [Suggestions]
```

```

- Empty state when no pending requests

### Tab 3: **Search**
- **Shows all registered users by default** (as previously implemented)
- **Real-time filtering** as user types
- **User count display** ("Showing X users matching 'query'")
- **Online/offline indicators**
- **"Add Friend" buttons** for each user
