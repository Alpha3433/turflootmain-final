The AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing and enhancing the TurfLoot multiplayer game. Initially, the engineer resolved critical rendering and  handling issues in , ensuring all players were theoretically processed. A significant challenge involved debugging and correcting the  flag synchronization, which led to incorrect game engine recreation and input failures. After fixing player movement, the focus shifted to refining camera stability and player visibility in multiplayer.

A major architectural decision was to create a dedicated  for pure Colyseus multiplayer, separating it from the original  to eliminate conflicts. This involved updating routing and debugging import/constructor issues with the Colyseus client. Finally, the engineer addressed an issue where player names were appearing as Anonymous%20Player, implementing fixes for URL decoding and consistent name display. The trajectory concludes with these username display fixes applied, awaiting user validation.

<product_requirements>
The TurfLoot application, an Agar.io-style multiplayer game, leverages Next.js, Colyseus for real-time multiplayer, and Privy for authentication. The project's goal is to transition from an MVP to a robust, user-friendly game experience.

**Key Requirements and Implementations:**

1.  **Server Browser**: Enabled dynamic display of active Colyseus rooms, including a 24/7 persistent global-turfloot-arena. Fixed  for  and infinite loading loops.
2.  **Authentication (Privy)**: Integrated Privy for user login, ensuring user IDs and names are passed to game sessions.
3.  **Multiplayer Core (Colyseus)**:
    *   Resolved version mismatches and schema definition errors between client and server.
    *   Implemented a persistent Colyseus room for consistent gameplay.
    *   Addressed initial issues where players weren't rendered due to  iteration errors and  synchronization.
    *   Fixed issues with player input not reaching the server and camera darting between players.
    *   **New Feature**: Created a dedicated  for pure Colyseus multiplayer, removing local fallbacks to simplify logic and prevent conflicts.
    *   **New Feature**: Enhanced minimap to display other live players (green dots) distinct from AI enemies (red dots).
    *   Ensured consistent world state (coins, viruses) across all connected players.
4.  **AI Bots**: Implemented intelligent bots for a local practice mode (), with distinct behaviors and visual indicators, ensuring they do not interfere with online multiplayer.

**Key Files and Changes during trajectory:**

*   ****
    *   **Importance:** Original client-side game logic, now primarily for local practice mode.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   Fixed MapSchema rendering by converting  from  to array iteration (lines 1202, 2974).
        *   Ensured  sync by adding  to  dependency array (line 3606).
        *   Reverted camera smoothing and player position interpolation fixes due to introducing desync (lines 2934-2935, 1246-1247).
        *   Refactored game initialization to prevent recreation when  changes.
        *   Removed local world generation (, , ) for multiplayer.
        *   Added numerous debugging logs for rendering, input, and state synchronization.
*   ** (NEW FILE)**
    *   **Importance:** Dedicated page for pure Colyseus multiplayer gameplay.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   Created as a new file to isolate multiplayer logic from local fallbacks.
        *   Initial structure includes Colyseus connection, game engine initialization, and rendering for server state.
        *   Fixed import path for  (from  to ).
        *   Changed import from dynamic  to direct  (lines 40, 31).
        *   Fixed  by using the default singleton  instance (lines 41, 31).
        *   Implemented camera smoothing and boundary constraints (lines 196-200).
        *   Enhanced player identification to resolve camera darting issue (lines 74, 196).
        *   Implemented a dedicated  instance per arena to prevent session ID conflicts (lines 38, 41).
        *   Applied  for player names in rendering (line 218).
*   ****
    *   **Importance:** Main landing page, handles initial routing to game modes.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   Modified  to redirect to  instead of  for multiplayer games (line 1878).
        *   Ensured  is properly URL-encoded when passed to the arena (line 1890).
*   ****
    *   **Importance:** Colyseus client-side library.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   Modified export strategy to expose both the  class and a default singleton instance to resolve import issues (lines 216-217).
        *   Added  and  to  options for proper player identification (line 33).
*   ****
    *   **Importance:** Displays available game servers.
    *   **Changes:** No direct code changes within this file were highlighted in the trajectory, but its implicit behavior changed due to modifications in  redirecting to .

<pending_tasks>
-   The user reported that the in-game usernames still appear as Anonymous Player (Chat Message 322). Although fixes have been implemented by the AI engineer, this task remains pending until user confirmation.
-   Verification of camera stability and player tracking after the latest fixes for session ID stability.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate work focused on resolving the issue where player names were displaying as Anonymous%20Player instead of the actual user-provided names in the  multiplayer mode.

Specifically, the AI engineer made the following changes:
1.  ****:
    *   Applied  when rendering player names to correctly display them (Chat Message 330, likely around line 218).
    *   Added debugging logs to show raw and decoded player name parameters upon game initialization to verify the fix (Chat Message 328).
2.  ****:
    *   Reviewed and confirmed that  is being correctly extracted and URL-encoded before being passed to the arena page via URL parameters (Chat Message 326).

These changes aim to ensure that the actual usernames are properly decoded and displayed above the players' circles in the multiplayer arena. The trajectory ends with the engineer awaiting user feedback to confirm the resolution of this issue.

<optional_next_step>
Test the multiplayer arena to confirm player names display correctly after the recent fixes.
