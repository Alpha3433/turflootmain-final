The trajectory details the debugging and refactoring of a split mechanic in a multiplayer game, TurfLoot Arena. The user reported that the player's character wasn't splitting in half as it should, unlike the reference  mode. The AI engineer initially diagnosed this as a client-side logic flaw, where new pieces were created without reducing the main player's mass. The engineer attempted a fix by porting the correct logic from the reference  file into .

However, this client-side fix failed. The user confirmed the issue persisted. Through further investigation, prompted by a user-provided screenshot, the engineer discovered the architectural root cause: the game uses a server-authoritative model with Colyseus. The client-side mass changes were being constantly overwritten by state updates from the server via an  listener.

Realizing this, the engineer correctly pivoted. The  function in  was refactored to remove all local state manipulation and instead send a single split command to the server via WebSocket, entrusting the server to manage the game state. The final steps involved troubleshooting why verification tests were failing, with a troubleshooter concluding that the new code is likely correct but the testing environment itself isn't successfully entering the game arena to trigger the mechanic.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to make the multiplayer TurfLoot Arena mode's split mechanic functionally identical to the single-player  practice mode. When a player presses the spacebar, their character (a circular cell) should divide in half. The original cell's mass must be correctly distributed among the new, smaller pieces, which are then propelled forward in the direction of the mouse cursor. The implementation must be stable, operate within the existing server-authoritative Colyseus architecture, and not cause player disconnections. The previous implementation was flawed as it created new projectiles without splitting the original player cell, which was a core deviation from the required agario-like behavior.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Colyseus**: A server-authoritative multiplayer game server framework. Understanding its state synchronization model was crucial to solving the core issue.
- **Client-Server State Synchronization**: The primary challenge was that the server's  updates were overwriting local client-side logic, making a client-only solution impossible.
- **WebSocket Communication**: Used as the mechanism for the client to send user commands, such as the split request, to the Colyseus server.
- **Canvas API**: Used for all client-side rendering of game entities.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a Next.js frontend with a Colyseus multiplayer backend. The core game logic is split between client-side rendering and server-side state management.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This file is the client-side entry point for the multiplayer arena. It manages the connection to the Colyseus server, handles user input (including the spacebar for splitting), and renders the game state onto an HTML5 canvas.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: This file underwent a significant architectural refactor. The  function was the main focus. Initially, it contained complex client-side logic that attempted to replicate the split mechanic locally. This was identified as incorrect because server state updates would override it. The entire local split logic was removed. The function was simplified to do one thing: send a split command to the server.

      **Final  Logic:**
      

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This file contains the logic for a single-player, client-side version of the game. It served as the golden standard or reference for how the split mechanic *should* behave visually and logically.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: This file was not modified. It was used purely for reading and comparison to understand the target functionality and to initially debug the flawed logic in .

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the authoritative server-side logic for the game room. It manages player state, physics, and actions. The final, correct solution relies entirely on this server script to receive the 'split' message and execute the split logic, then broadcast the new state to all clients.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: This file was not modified during the trajectory, but the investigation revealed that all authoritative game logic must reside here.

<pending_tasks>
-   The primary pending task is to successfully verify that the refactored, server-authoritative split mechanic works as requested by the user. All previous verification attempts failed because the automated testing environment could not successfully load into the game arena to trigger the functionality.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a critical refactor of the split mechanic in . The root cause of the feature malfunction was identified as an architectural misunderstanding: attempting to implement the split logic on the client-side in a server-authoritative game. Any local changes to the player's mass and pieces were being overwritten by the Colyseus server's state updates.

The fix involved removing all client-side split logic from the  function. The function now exclusively sends a 'split' command to the server via WebSocket, delegating the entire responsibility for handling the split to the backend.

Immediately following this change, the engineer attempted to verify the fix but ran into issues where automated tests failed to enter the game arena. A  was invoked, which concluded that the new server-centric approach is correct, but the verification process itself is flawed. The current state is that the code has been corrected based on the proper architecture, but it remains unverified due to issues with the testing environment.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Fix the testing environment to ensure it can successfully enter the game arena, allowing for an end-to-end verification of the server-side split mechanic.
