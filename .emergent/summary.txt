The trajectory details the AI engineer's efforts to stabilize and enhance the TurfLoot application, primarily tackling persistent  and  errors on the preview deployment. Initial work focused on fixing API routing by adjusting  and then explicitly hardcoding API calls to , which resolved issues locally but broke preview functionality. A dynamic  utility was introduced to adapt URLs based on the environment. Despite these code-level fixes, the  errors persisted on the preview URL, leading to the identification of an underlying Kubernetes ingress configuration issue. The AI engineer attempted Next.js rewrites and middleware, which proved ineffective for the  errors. A significant breakthrough occurred when a new  endpoint, not prefixed with , successfully returned a , confirming that external routing was partially functional. This led to the current strategy: creating new API endpoints outside the problematic  path to bypass the ingress restriction. Concurrently, the AI completed the server-side friends system with authentication and real-time notifications, and name saving, all verified to work at 100% on localhost.

<product_requirements>
TurfLoot is an Agar.io-style multiplayer online game. Initial requirements included mobile joysticks, minimap, stats, leaderboards, orientation gate, cell mechanics (splitting, orb collection, merge timers), mock data for paid lobbies (-00), and backend for paid rooms, cash-out, and mission rewards.

The previous AI engineer made significant progress:
- **Mobile customization/social popup/navigation bar redesign**: Navigation bar with region selector, settings, login, and horizontal mobile cycling implemented. Customization and social popups are ongoing.
- **Dynamic Players in Game update**: Backend ready, frontend partially implemented.
- **Compact region selection (Oceania & latency)**: Implemented.
- **Fix 0 balance display**: Addressed.
- **Username section redesign & errors**: Backend and frontend implemented with a dedicated bulletproof names API, removing client-side fallbacks. Persistent 502 errors on preview were blocking this.
- **Lobby button**: Implemented and streamlined with operational backend.
- **Real-time social features**: Friends panel, online status, shared practice mode via Socket.IO, friend request notifications, and server-side-only friends functionality.
- **Mobile vertical view/spacing/eye spacing fixes**: Implemented.

The primary problem at hand has been the persistent  and  errors on the preview deployment, preventing server-side name changes and friend requests from functioning externally, despite the code being complete and working locally. The current focus is to resolve these external API access issues.

    -   **Importance**: Critical for persistent username storage.
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   **Summary**: A simple health check endpoint.
    -   **Changes**: Created to test external routing outside the  prefix. Its success indicated specific  path blocking.
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   **Summary**: An alternative endpoint for name-related API calls.
    -   **Changes**: Created as a bypass to the problematic  prefix to ensure name saving works externally.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was attempting to resolve the persistent  errors affecting all API calls on the preview deployment (e.g., ). Despite successfully implementing a dynamic  utility in  and  to intelligently switch between  and relative  URLs based on the environment, the preview deployment continued to return  for these  calls.

This led to the confirmation that the issue is external to the application code, residing within the Kubernetes ingress or gateway configuration. Attempts to add rewrite rules in  and enhance the  to handle API routing also failed to resolve the  errors. A crucial diagnostic step was the creation of a new, non- prefixed health endpoint (), which successfully returned a  from the preview deployment. This breakthrough indicated that external routing *is* possible for some paths, but specifically blocked for paths starting with .

The AI engineer has now started creating new API endpoints, such as , to bypass the problematic  prefix and enable the server-side name change and friend request functionalities on the preview deployment. The internal implementation of server-side name changes, friend requests, and notifications is 100% complete and verified working on . The current focus is on adapting the frontend to use these new bypass endpoints, effectively working around the infrastructure limitation.
