The trajectory outlines a comprehensive development effort to transform the TurfLoot game from a local MVP into a stable multiplayer arena. Initially, the AI engineer addressed a camera stability issue and incorrect player name display. The camera instability was first attributed to client-side logic but was later correctly diagnosed by the user as duplicate player spawning. This led to significant server-side deduplication logic in  and client-side camera validation in . Subsequently, the project moved to porting all UI/UX elements and game mechanics (like cashout, split) from the local  to the multiplayer . This process involved multiple iterations of fixing compilation errors, rendering issues (black screen), and persistent duplicate player problems due to flawed deduplication logic and client-side race conditions. A critical pivot was the user's request to enforce Privy authentication for arena access, which ultimately resolved persistent duplicate player issues. Finally, visual enhancements were applied, and a mouse movement bug was addressed, which further revealed underlying Colyseus connection stability problems, leading to enhanced connection handling and debugging in . The current state involves debugging the Colyseus connection issue, as the client reports DISCONNECTED.

<product_requirements>
The TurfLoot application is an Agar.io-style multiplayer game, aiming for a stable and user-friendly experience. It uses Next.js, Colyseus for real-time multiplayer, and Privy for authentication.

The product's key features and their journey through implementation include:
1.  **Server Browser**: Allows players to find and join active Colyseus rooms. This was a core component from the start.
2.  **Authentication (Privy)**: Integrated for user login, passing unique IDs and names to game sessions. Initially, anonymous play was allowed, which caused issues. The explicit requirement later shifted to only allow Privy-authenticated users in the arena.
3.  **Multiplayer Core (Colyseus)**: Addressed client-server schema mismatches, ensuring a persistent room. Player rendering, input, and camera darting were initial concerns. A dedicated  was created. Initial issues with duplicate player spawning (due to faulty server-side deduplication and anonymous players) were a major focus.
4.  **AI Bots**: Developed for the  local practice mode and are not intended for online multiplayer.
5.  **Player Names**: Resolved Anonymous%20Player display by URL decoding in .
6.  **Camera Stability**: Initially unstable, with rapid switching between player instances. The root cause was identified as duplicate player spawning.
7.  **UI/UX Parity**: A key request was to port all UI/UX features (leaderboard, minimap, stats, mobile joystick) and visual elements (coins, viruses) 1:1 from the local  mode to the multiplayer  mode.
8.  **Game Mechanics Porting**: Transferred core mechanics like Cash Out (hold E), Split (spacebar), and player movement logic from the local mode to the arena.
9.  **Visual Enhancements**: Updated the arena to a richer visual style, including a darker background, enhanced player rendering, and improved coin/virus graphics.
10. **Button Layout**: Adjusted the placement of game action buttons (Cash Out, Split) in the arena for better UI/UX.
11. **Mouse Movement**: Ensured player character accurately follows mouse direction in arena mode, which involved fixing client-side coordinate calculation and server-side input processing.
12. **Colyseus Connection Stability**: Ongoing debugging to ensure reliable connection to the Colyseus server.

<pending_tasks>
-   Investigate and resolve the persisting Colyseus DISCONNECTED status reported by the user in the arena, despite enhanced client-side connection debugging.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a critical Colyseus connection issue in the multiplayer arena. The user reported that their character was not moving, and console logs indicated . This showed that the Colyseus connection was stuck.

The AI engineer implemented fixes in  (Chat 363):
-   **Enhanced Connection Handling**: Added proper error handlers (, ) and connection retry logic (3-second retry on failure).
-   **Removed Problematic Parameters**: Removed  and  from  as they were suspected of causing connection hangs.
-   **Detailed Logging**: Added more detailed console logging to track connection status, endpoint, environment variables, player details, and specific error messages.

After these changes, the user reported accidentally broke arena multiplayer via colyseus (Chat 366). The AI engineer then investigated, confirming that direct access to  correctly redirected to the main page (authentication working as intended) and that the Colyseus API was responding. However, the user then clarified that the game still reported DISCONNECTED in the arena (Chat 378).

In response, the AI engineer made further enhancements to the Colyseus connection logic in  (Chat 382):
-   **Increased Debugging**: Even more detailed logs for endpoint, environment variables, and error info.
-   **Connection Timeout**: Implemented a 15-second timeout to prevent hanging connections.
-   **Improved Error Handling**: Detailed error logging with stack traces.
-   **Retry Logic**: Refined 5-second retry with better logging.
-   **Environment Validation**: Added checks to ensure environment variables are correctly set.

The current state is that these latest connection debugging and stability improvements have been applied, and the AI engineer has asked the user to re-test the arena and check browser console logs for specific connection failure messages. The core issue of the arena showing DISCONNECTED persists.
