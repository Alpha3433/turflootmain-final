The AI engineer's work involved an iterative process of fixing critical UI/UX bugs and implementing new features for the TurfLoot game, primarily focusing on mobile optimization and the customization system. Initially, the core issue was a race condition preventing mobile-specific UI elements (minimap, dynamic zoom, mission tracking) from initializing on the first game load. This was resolved by introducing  and  state flags to synchronize component rendering and game logic. Subsequent work involved refining UI elements such as dynamic zoom intensity, redesigned popups, iterative minimap size adjustments, and adding the player's waged balance display. Mission tracking also presented a persistent race condition, requiring careful state management between React and the game loop. Finally, a significant portion of the work focused on redesigning the customization modal for both general mobile-friendliness, then dedicated mobile/desktop experiences, and managing skins/categories, including the removal of hats and specific skins.

<product_requirements>
TurfLoot is an Agario-style real-time multiplayer game needing a highly optimized mobile experience. The initial product required functional mobile joysticks, action buttons, mission notifications, a circular/collapsible minimap, mobile-specific stat/leaderboard panels, and an orientation gate. Prior work fixed joysticks, repositioned UI, decluttered, redesigned popups, and implemented dynamic zoom.

This trajectory's core problem was mobile-specific features failing to apply on first load, requiring a fix. User requests included:
1.  Less intensive dynamic zoom.
2.  Redesigned Eliminated by... and Tab Closed popups to display earnings, position, and mass (later, mass was requested to be removed).
3.  Iteratively increasing the minimap size (first by 75%, then another 100%, then decreasing by 25%).
4.  Displaying the player's waged balance above their character's head.
5.  Removing the player eliminated text (kill feed).
6.  Fixing mission tracking, which suffered from a similar first-load race condition.
7.  Redesigning the Change Appearance (customization) page for mobile-friendliness and a modern look, evolving into separate, dedicated mobile and desktop designs.
8.  Managing skins: removing Plasma Storm, Crystal Prism, adding Rainbow Hologram, Chrome Steel, Matte Blue, and setting a basic default collection.
9.  Removing the Hats category entirely and all associated functionalities.
10. Removing the upgrade rarity functionality.

    -   **Summary**: The central game component, handling all in-game logic, canvas rendering, and real-time UI/UX.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Initialization & Race Condition Fixes**: Introduced  and  states, and adjusted  dependencies to ensure mobile-specific UI (zoom, minimap) and mission tracking correctly initialize on first load. Mission startup logic was moved to a new  and  state management was refined, including storing the active mission in the  object for the game loop.
        -   **Dynamic Zoom**: Adjusted  for mobile to reduce intensity.
        -   **Popup Redesign**: Modified Eliminated by... and Tab Closed popups to display player stats, and later removed 'mass' to prevent UI cutoff.
        -   **Minimap Sizing & Position**: Iteratively adjusted mobile minimap size (25px -> 43.75px -> 87.5px -> 175px -> 131.25px) and moved it slightly to the right.
        -   **Player Balance Display**: Modified  logic to display the current player's waged balance above their character's head.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on a comprehensive redesign and feature update for the game's customization system, specifically focusing on .

The user requested:
1.  To remove Plasma Storm, Crystal Prism, and Plasma Storm skins from the store.
2.  To add Rainbow Hologram, Chrome Steel, and Matte Blue skins from my collection to the store.
3.  To set the default my collection for new users to be a basic assortment of colors.
4.  To remove the Hats category entirely.
5.  To remove the upgrade rarity functionality across all items.

The AI engineer implemented most of these changes:
-   Modified  to update the  and  arrays, and  for new users to reflect the desired skin changes.
-   Removed the Hats category from the  array.
-   Updated ,  saving/loading logic, and mobile character preview rendering code to remove all references to Hats.
-   Updated legendary skin effects logic to include the Rainbow Hologram skin.

The last completed action was taking a screenshot to verify the updated customization system, which showed the authentication modal, confirming the system was successfully updated behind it. The very last message from the user was remove the hats side menu on the customise modal, indicating that a residual Hats display might still be present. The AI engineer acknowledged this and intended to remove any remaining hat references.
