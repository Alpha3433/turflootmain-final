The AI engineer's work primarily focused on transitioning TurfLoot to a Hathora-first multiplayer architecture, involving extensive debugging and iterative fixes. Initially, successful integration of the Hathora SDK in  was achieved, replacing a mock system, alongside resolving Helius API key issues for the wallet. The persistent  for WebSocket connections was initially attributed to the lack of a deployed game server. After deploying the game server and encountering issues with the existing Hathora app configuration, a new Hathora application () was created and successfully deployed. Further debugging addressed a JSON parsing error (identified as a frontend timeout/race condition) and connection spikes. The most recent critical finding, following user-provided console logs, revealed a  security error: the application, served over HTTPS, was attempting to connect to an insecure  WebSocket endpoint, a regression from an earlier fix. The current task is to revert this change and use .

The TurfLoot application is designed as an Agar.io-style, military-themed multiplayer game, leveraging Hathora for authoritative game servers and Privy for authentication, targeting both mobile and desktop. The core objective is a full transition to a Hathora-based multiplayer experience. Key features include a dynamic Server Browser with real-time player counts and CDN-based ping, a functional Wallet using the Helius API, and robust Hathora integration for room management (creation, region mapping, authenticated WebSocket connections). This eliminates local server fallbacks, with all game logic residing server-side. The strategy is Server Browser-First, listing active rooms before creating new ones. A defined Room Lifecycle ensures on-demand room creation with an 8-minute keep-alive. WebSocket transport operates at a 20 Hz tick rate. Spectator and Party support are required, along with Hathora Console monitoring. Server-side bot management for auto-fill is explicitly not required. The previous mock room system has been successfully replaced with real Hathora SDK integration.

<code_architecture>

- : Main landing page; initiates game sessions.
  - Changes: Refactored  for server-side room creation, updated navigation parameters for , , etc. Integrated Helius API key.
- : Client-side game logic and WebSocket connection.
  - Changes: Refactored WebSocket connection to use URL parameters. Initially changed  to  for WebSocket URL, but this needs to be reverted to  due to Mixed Content error. Also, aggressive auto-reconnect logic was updated for better stability.
- : Server-side API endpoint for Hathora room creation.
  - Changes: Replaced mock logic with real Hathora SDK calls for , , . Debugged parameter passing and response handling. Added a  block with retry logic for fetch calls.
- : Client-side Hathora API wrapper.
  - Changes: Updated to make  calls to the server API route  instead of direct SDK interaction. Added timeout and enhanced error handling.
- : Environment variables.
  - Changes:  was updated, and  was updated to  (new Hathora app ID).
- : Directory for the custom Hathora game server.
  - Files created: , , , , .
  - Changes:  (presumably  from directory listing, but referred to as  in execution logs) was modified to include a  message handler.

- Resolve the  error (if still present).
- Mobile Customization Screen Redesign.
- Modernizing Social Popup.
- Production Infrastructure Stability for  calls.
- Implement core  button functionality in Wallet Snapshot.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully resolved several critical issues. The application now uses a fresh Hathora application (, ID: ) with a properly deployed game server (Deployment ID: 2, Build ID: 3), which was confirmed to be handling  messages correctly and reducing connection spikes by increasing reconnect delays. The wallet functionality was also verified by updating the  in  and confirming Helius RPC endpoint calls work.

The immediate problem being addressed is a persistent WebSocket connection failure, reported by the user and confirmed by console logs. Earlier, the  protocol in  was changed to  to address connection issues. However, the application's frontend is served over HTTPS, leading to a  security error where the browser blocks insecure  WebSocket connections from an HTTPS page. This means the previous  fix was incorrect in the context of the HTTPS deployment environment, and the WebSocket URL in  needs to be reverted to  to establish secure connections.

<optional_next_step>
Revert the WebSocket URL protocol from  back to  in .
