The AI engineer's work on the TurfLoot application primarily focused on enhancing the mobile UI/UX and in-game experience, iteratively addressing user feedback and resolving numerous technical challenges. Key accomplishments include comprehensive mobile responsiveness across the landing page and in-game screens, with specific attention to orientation handling, virtual joystick functionality, and compact UI designs for stats panels and leaderboards. Critical bug fixes included resolving Helius RPC authentication issues and a persistent  in the withdrawal flow. The engineer also introduced new features like animated in-game viruses, a player report system (temporarily simplified for build stability), and a highly functional, redesigned cash-out modal. Significant effort was dedicated to debugging complex JSX build errors and ensuring  dependencies were correctly installed, maintaining application stability. The current focus is on final visual refinements for the cash-out modal.

<product_requirements>
The TurfLoot application is an Agar.io-style multiplayer game with a military theme, leveraging Hathora for game servers and Privy for wallet/authentication. The project's objective is to expand the MVP's functionality through UI/UX improvements, bug resolutions, and the integration of social features, with a paramount focus on the mobile user experience.

**Implemented features so far**: Mobile UI has been redesigned to a vertical stack (WALLET, CUSTOMIZE, LEADERBOARD, PARTY). Character customization now features a blue circular avatar with scroll-based eye-tracking. In-game mobile buttons (CASH OUT, SPLIT) are optimized. A persistent friends/party system is in place, with mobile PARTY panel aligning with desktop. Full mobile support includes a virtual in-game joystick. Core game mechanics like splitting, ejection, merging, real-time Time Alive, and cash-out are functional. Critical bugs, including Solana deposit fixes, Privy login issues,  modal delay,  implementation, mobile background reset, and removal of mobile WITHDRAW button authentication popup, have been addressed. Dynamic player names are displayed on the mobile navigation bar. In-game mobile stats panel and leaderboard now feature minimalist designs with sub-labels, and in-game viruses are animated. A player report system (frontend, backend API) and a robust, mobile-optimized withdrawal modal that matches the landing page's design and functionality have been implemented.

<code_architecture>

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Primary client-side landing page, managing UI, user authentication, pre-game interactions, and the main wallet/withdrawal functionality.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented mobile orientation enforcement. Integrated and extensively redesigned the  component. This involved fixing  by correctly referencing  and , adding amount input with MAX/HALF buttons, dynamic percentage display, destination address field, and insufficient balance warnings. The modal's typography (Rajdhani font) and color scheme (green/orange accents) were updated to match the landing page.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains the core in-game experience, including canvas rendering, player controls, and all in-game UI elements (leaderboard, minimap, stats panel, game over/cash out popups).
    -   **Changes Made**: Enhanced mobile detection for in-game features. The mobile in-game **Stats Panel** was simplified, adding sub-labels like Net Worth, Mass, K/D, Streak, Time, and removing currency/flame emojis. The mobile **Leaderboard** was also redesigned for minimalism, removing the trophy emoji, adding Rank and Score sub-labels, and adjusting font sizes for player names and players in game text to prevent truncation. **Minimap** was cleaned by removing coin and virus dots for both desktop and mobile. The **Elimination Message** was changed to You have been eliminated!. Both **Game Over** and **Cash Out Success** modals were redesigned for mobile, making them more compact. In-game **Viruses** ( method) were made animated with glowing, pulsing, rotating, and spiking effects. A **Player Report System** was added with a REPORT PLAYER button (emoji removed) and a report modal (temporarily simplified for build stability), with options refined and textbox overflow fixed. Desktop UI bugs involving floating CASH OUT and SPLIT buttons were fixed by conditionally rendering them only for mobile. Numerous JSX syntax and structural errors were identified and resolved through iterative debugging.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines the root layout and metadata for the Next.js application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added mobile-specific viewport metadata (, ) and iOS Safari  CSS for full-screen game canvas.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Global CSS styles for the application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Included  for animations, comprehensive CSS for full-screen game canvas,  class styles, CSS media queries for mobile layout, and joystick animation styles.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Backend API endpoint for receiving user report submissions.
    -   **Changes Made**: New file created to handle POST requests, storing report data.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on further refining the  modal, located in . Following a complete redesign to match a user-provided functional layout and extensive styling to align with the TurfLoot landing page's Rajdhani font and green/orange color scheme, the user requested two additional visual tweaks.

The user explicitly requested:
1.  **Dynamic Balance Color**: Change the Available Balance text color from its current static red to dynamically display green when the user has a positive balance, and red when the balance is zero.
2.  **Smaller Placeholder Text**: Reduce the font size of the Enter Solana wallet address placeholder text within the input field of the Cash Out modal.

The AI engineer has just received this request and is poised to implement these final visual enhancements to the  modal to ensure it is fully polished and provides intuitive visual feedback. The Cash Out modal currently handles amount input, MAX/HALF button functionality, balance percentage calculation, and displays a destination address field, all while being optimized for mobile.
