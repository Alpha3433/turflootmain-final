The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enhancing the TurfLoot application, moving from critical bug fixes to significant feature additions. Initially, the engineer tackled recurring black screen errors and 500 server errors, stabilizing the core application by correcting JavaScript scope issues, API route handling, and crucially, properly initializing the Socket.IO game server via supervisor configuration.

A major development involved refining the Party Lobby system, addressing issues where party members failed to join the same game instance. This necessitated adjustments in game server logic, robust URL parameter parsing, and React state management. Subsequently, a game loading popup was introduced, backend API stability improved (e.g., global practice server fix), and client-side polling optimized to prevent 429 errors. Mobile UI enhancements included navigation bar scrolling fixes and conditional rendering for notifications.

The most recent and extensive task was the implementation and iterative refinement of a Spectator Mode. This involved several design iterations, from initial broad camera controls to a simplified auto-spectate, player-following-only experience with matching in-game button styles. Key technical challenges included integrating spectator logic into the Socket.IO game server, preventing player spawning in spectator mode, correctly rendering the game canvas for spectators with virtual bots, and fixing numerous React hook and state management errors. The current state reflects a sophisticated auto-spectate feature directly integrated into the main game UI, allowing seamless transition to playing.

TurfLoot is an Agar.io-style game with core mechanics, minimap, stats, leaderboards, and persistent usernames. Initial challenges included  errors and a need for a re-architected social system. The primary recent requirement was a Party Lobby system for creating parties, inviting friends, and ensuring all members join the same game instance, with a 2-player cap, owner-only room selection, persistent state, and mobile optimization. Further requirements included a game loading popup, minimap visualization for partied players, and mobile UI fixes (nav bar scrolling, logout button, non-intrusive notifications). The most recent, evolving requirement has been a Spectator Mode: initially, with advanced camera controls and UI overlay; then simplified to auto-spectate, following players/bots with cycle controls and matching in-game buttons; and finally, seamlessly loading the *real* game UI as a pure spectator, with an immediate Join Match transition, and ensuring bots are visible.

-   ****: Main landing page.

-   ****: The main game page.
    -   **Importance**: This file evolved to become the central point for the final Spectator Mode implementation.
    -   **Changes**: Initially, it received party/game parameters. For spectator mode, it was extensively modified to:
        - Detect  and  URL parameters.
        - Prevent player spawning and rendering when in spectator mode.
        - Modify the Cash Out button to Join Match when spectating.
        - Add spectator-specific Socket.IO event handlers (, ).
        - Implement camera logic to follow bots/players and allow cycling.
        - Modify  and  to accommodate spectator-only connections.
        - Remove player cell rendering logic when in spectator mode.
        - Add keyboard controls for cycling through bots (A/D).
-   ****: Core Socket.IO game server logic.
    -   **Importance**: Manages real-time game state, player connections, and now bot simulation for spectators.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to preserve party room IDs, store the game server instance in . A significant change was adding  to create virtual bots when a practice room has only spectators,  to include these bots, and stopping bot simulation in . Fixed a syntax error in  method.
-   ****: Global styles. Minor changes for mobile UI.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical user feedback: despite successfully implementing a true spectator mode on the  page (where the player character was not spawned), the user still observed a controllable blue player and the normal game UI, not the intended spectator experience of following bots/players.

The AI engineer identified that the rendering logic and camera controls in  were still drawing the You player and centering the camera on it, even when  was active. The work involved:
1.  **Modifying camera logic** () to follow bots/other players instead of the  when in spectator mode.
2.  **Preventing player cell rendering** by adding conditional checks () around various  loops responsible for drawing player cells.
3.  **Adding keyboard controls** (A/D) for cycling through spectated bots.
4.  **Updating camera logic** to follow the specific targeted bot/player.

The last action was to restart the server after applying these changes, suggesting a readiness to test the refined pure spectator experience where the user truly observes and cycles through bots without controlling their own character, all within the real game UI.

Restart the Next.js server to apply recent changes for the refined spectator mode.
