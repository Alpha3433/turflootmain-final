The trajectory chronicles the AI engineer's journey in stabilizing and enhancing the TurfLoot application. Initially, the focus was on resolving persistent  errors on the preview deployment, primarily for  routes due to Kubernetes ingress issues. The AI engineer implemented and refined a dynamic  utility and created specific bypass API endpoints (e.g., , ) to circumvent the  route blocking.

Following this, the engineer rebuilt the friends system from the ground up, incorporating advanced features like rate limiting, presence tracking, and robust friend management. This also involved fixing a  error, redesigning the friends search to display all users, and integrating Privy authentication with custom display names. Demo user data was meticulously cleaned.

The current phase involves developing a comprehensive Party Lobby system. The initial implementation focused on core party management, invitations, and member status, but a user clarification shifted the requirement: the lobby should be general, not room-specific, with all party members following the owner into any chosen game room. The AI engineer is actively working on integrating this party system with a new general lobby backend, including a  and updating the smart routing configuration.

TurfLoot is an Agar.io-style multiplayer online game. Initial features included mobile joysticks, minimap, stats, leaderboards, orientation gate, and core cell mechanics. Product evolution includes a redesigned navigation bar, dynamic Players in Game updates, compact region selection, 0 balance display fix, and a bulletproof username system.
A key problem was  and  errors on preview for  routes. This led to creating bypass API endpoints (e.g., , ) to ensure name saving and friends functionality worked externally.
The social system was re-architected to include robust friend management (cannot friend self/duplicates, accept creates friendship once, block removes/prevents requests, smart search exclusions, rate limiting, and real-time Socket.IO events for all actions).
The most recent request is to build a Party Lobby system. Users should create a party, invite friends, and upon acceptance, the party owner can join any game room, with all party members automatically following into that room.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on the Party Lobby system. The user clarified that the lobby should not be tied to a specific room type but should be a general party. The party owner would then choose a game room, and all party members would automatically be taken to that room/game.

The AI engineer has created  to handle this general lobby functionality. This involves creating a lobby that isn't room-specific, allowing the party owner to initiate joining a room, and then facilitating all party members to follow. The  utility in  and the  configuration have been updated to support and correctly route calls to this new .

The previous backend testing for the Party Lobby () confirmed core party creation, invitation, acceptance, and membership tracking. However, the user's latest feedback highlights the need to integrate this party system with a *general* game lobby, and ensure party members join rooms together. The AI engineer is currently in the process of thoroughly testing this party-integrated lobby system, specifically verifying that multiple party members can join the same room automatically after the owner initiates it.
