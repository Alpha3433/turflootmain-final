A significant, multi-iterative feature was the Spectator Mode, which evolved from initial implementation to full removal, addressing authentication, rendering glitches, and proper bot display. Subsequently, the PRACTICE WITH BOTS mode was enhanced to be a persistent, always-active arena with growing bots and accurate player stats. The most recent, substantial effort involved integrating Hathora for global multiplayer, configuring regions, handling deployment artifacts, and updating the client to prioritize Hathora connections.

TurfLoot, an Agar.io-style game, required fixing  errors and improving a social system. Recent focus was on a Party Lobby (create/invite, 2-player cap, owner room selection, persistent state, mobile optimization), game loading popups, minimap for partied players, and mobile UI fixes. A major evolving requirement was Spectator Mode: initially advanced camera controls, then simplified auto-spectate following players/bots, and finally a *pure spectator* loading *real* game UI with Join Match and visible bots. This mode was ultimately requested to be completely removed. The PRACTICE WITH BOTS mode needed to be a single, always-on server allowing multiple devices to join in-progress matches, with immediate bot/coin visibility on first load. Dynamic leaderboard (by eliminations) and wallet balance (by Privy Ethereum balance) were requested. The final overarching goal was to host global multiplayer servers for TurfLoot, initially for OCE, US, and Europe regions, using Hathora.

    -   **Summary**: The core game canvas, rendering, and client-side game logic. This file underwent extensive modifications for Spectator Mode, its subsequent removal, and persistent practice mode.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Spectator Mode (Implemented & Removed)**: Initially modified to detect  URL params, prevent player spawning/rendering, change button text, add spectator Socket.IO handlers, implement camera logic, and add keyboard controls. Later, all references to ,  states, UI elements, and logic were completely removed.
        -   **Practice Mode**:  was adjusted to always run in offline mode ( for ) for  to mimic local Agario. Bot spawning logic was enhanced to ensure immediate bot and coin visibility on first load ( condition was fixed). Collision detection was modified to only increment  for human players and for bots to gain mass.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on integrating Hathora as the primary multiplayer server. The Hathora deployment to 4 global regions (Sydney, Washington DC, London, Frankfurt) was successfully configured and completed from the Hathora console. The current task was to configure the TurfLoot application to primarily use these newly deployed Hathora global servers for all multiplayer interactions (both desktop and mobile users).

The work involved:
1.  **Configuring Primary Hathora Connection**: Modifying  to ensure Hathora is the default connection method.
2.  **Updating Game Client**: Adjusting  in  to connect via  for all game modes, including practice.
3.  **Updating Practice Mode**: Ensuring the PRACTICE WITH BOTS mode also uses Hathora global servers instead of falling back to a local server.
4.  **Enhancing Hathora Room Management**: Modifying  to work better with TurfLoot's global room system.
5.  **Updating UI to Show Global Connection Status**: The last action in the trajectory () was to update the main page to reflect that users are connecting to global servers. This specific step was initiated but not completed when the trajectory ended.

The application's backend is successfully deployed on Hathora, and the client-side logic is being updated to prioritize connecting to these global servers. The next step is to complete the UI update to inform users of the global connection.
