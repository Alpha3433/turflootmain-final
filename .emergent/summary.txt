The previous AI engineer's work primarily revolved around fixing and enhancing the Privy Solana integration for the TurfLoot application's deposit functionality. Initially, minor fixes for invalid address and Agar.io game UI improvements were made. The core challenge was persistently ensuring Privy created and managed Solana wallets correctly, rather than defaulting to EVM wallets. This involved numerous iterations of debugging Privy configurations in  and , handling SDK version compatibility (v1.x to v2.24.0), and meticulously configuring various Privy settings. The  function was repeatedly refactored, attempting various approaches from custom bridges to , , , and  hooks. A recurring theme was overcoming dependency conflicts with Solana packages (, , ) and server-side rendering (SSR) issues related to browser-only APIs. Despite achieving successful Privy login modal display and wallet detection, the  function remained elusive. The work culminated in the critical discovery from Privy's changelog that  was deprecated in v2.22.0, and 's behavior in v2.24.0 is unclear.

<product_requirements>
The TurfLoot application is an Agar.io-style multiplayer game with a military theme, utilizing Hathora for game servers and Privy for wallet and authentication. The primary goal is to enhance the existing MVP through UI/UX improvements, bug fixes, and robust social features.

**Currently Implemented Features:**
-   **UI/UX**: Refined navigation, scrollable User Profile Modal.
-   **Social System**: Persistent friends system (requests, acceptance), comprehensive party system (public/private creation, friend invitations, invite management, real-time notification badges).
-   **Mobile Parity**: Full mobile support across social, wallet, leaderboard, and game controls.
-   **Game Mechanics**: Authentic Agar.io splitting, directional ejection, and merging.
-   **Bug Fixes**: Resolved random eliminations and premature game over popups.
-   **In-Game Metrics**: Real-time Time Alive metric that stops on cash-out.
-   **Cash-Out Visualization**: A subtle, non-intrusive visual cash-out progress ring in-game.

**The immediate problem being addressed:**
The Solana-only deposit functionality via Privy was broken; specifically, the DEPOSIT SOL button failed to trigger the Privy funding modal consistently, despite the user being authenticated and a Solana wallet existing. The previous engineer's task was to restore and ensure this critical functionality works correctly with Privy v2.24.0.

    -   **Changes Made**: Underwent extensive modifications to integrate Privy v2.24.0 hooks (, ,  (deprecated), ), remove a legacy  bridge, and refactor  multiple times. Changes included prioritizing Solana wallets, explicitly disabling EVM wallet handling, and various attempts to call  directly or through dynamic imports to mitigate SSR issues and address  not being found. Debugging efforts added retry mechanisms for wallet detection and detailed logging. The latest attempt involved importing  from  and using .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into debugging the persistent issue of the Privy funding modal not appearing when DEPOSIT SOL was clicked, even after successful user authentication and Solana wallet detection. Extensive efforts were made to correctly import and use the  hook from  within , while simultaneously battling recurrent dependency conflicts with , , and , and server-side rendering (SSR) errors related to browser-only APIs.

After multiple iterations involving conditional rendering, dynamic imports, and directly calling , the problem kept recurring as either module not found errors or SSR issues. The user then provided Privy v2.24.0 update notes and the full changelog. The AI engineer, reviewing the changelog, made a critical discovery:  was deprecated in v2.22.0. Furthermore,  was mentioned in v2.6.0 but its location or usage in v2.24.0 was not explicitly detailed in recent changelog entries.

The immediate last action was the AI engineer examining the full Privy changelog, and is now at the point of determining the correct approach to access the funding functionality in Privy v2.24.0, given the deprecation and lack of clear documentation for the latest SDK version.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate Privy v2.24.0 documentation/examples to find the correct, non-deprecated method for triggering the funding modal.
