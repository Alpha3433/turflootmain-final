The trajectory details an iterative development process for TurfLoot Arena, focusing on Solana-based paid room entries via Privy's embedded wallets. The AI engineer has consistently grappled with Privy 3.0 configuration,  errors, and  issues. Repeatedly, the AI attempted to integrate Helius RPC for balance fetching, then removed it for Privy-native methods, often re-introducing the same or similar errors. A core challenge was correctly configuring Privy wallet connectors and RPC endpoints, leading to frequent modifications in  and . The AI fixed an infinite re-rendering loop and the Privy transaction UI appearing. The immediate, recurring problem is the landing page displaying a /bin/bash SOL balance, even when the Privy modal shows a correct, authenticated user balance. The AI is currently investigating balance fetching logic and dependencies in .

<product_requirements>
The TurfLoot Arena application provides a multiplayer gaming experience with a key monetization feature: paid room entry fees.
1.  **Split Mechanic**: Server-authoritative player character splitting is implemented.
2.  **Game-Over Screen**: A custom game-over screen is displayed upon player elimination.
3.  **Paid Room Entry Fee (Privy/Solana Integration)**: Players entering paid arena rooms must be charged in Solana, exclusively using Privy's embedded wallets with Solana via Helius RPC and Privy 3.0 standards for signing.
    *   **Previous State**: A mock transaction ledger system with server-side balance () and Helius webhooks for real SOL/USDC deposits, converting to mock USD. Frontend displayed mock balance.
    *   **Latest Requirement**: Display *only* the real Privy embedded wallet SOL balance on the frontend, removing the mock balance. Room costs are fixed at /bin/bash.02, /bin/bash.05, /bin/bash.10 worth of Solana. Transactions should automatically send to the platform wallet upon joining a room. The latest user feedback indicates that the landing page balance is /bin/bash while the Privy modal shows the correct balance for an authenticated user, and no fallbacks should be used.

-   ****: This is the main application page handling user interface, authentication, and core transaction logic for paid room entry.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Numerous modifications to  for Solana transaction signing with Privy 3.0 hooks. Refactored  to serialize  objects. Updated stake button options and . Corrected  for embedded wallet addresses. Debugged and refined usage of  and  hooks. Introduced and removed Helius RPC-based balance fetching multiple times. Re-implemented and then removed . Fixed an infinite rendering loop in balance fetching logic. The current state reflects the re-integration of Helius RPC for balance display (as of message 462) and a fix for the Privy transaction UI. The balance display on the landing page for authenticated users is still a core issue being addressed.
-   ****: Configures Privy authentication, wallet connections, and Solana RPC.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Extensive refactoring to correctly configure Solana wallet connectors using  and later specific  RPCs via 's  and . Involved debugging and removing  hooks, and ensuring proper .  was added, removed, and added again due to various React hook and  errors. The RPC configuration has been updated to use the user-provided Helius API key with the correct  format.
-   ****: Manages project dependencies.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Fixed  and  versions. Added , , , and .

<pending_tasks>
-   Ensure the landing page wallet displays the *actual* Privy embedded wallet SOL balance for authenticated users, not /bin/bash.00.
-   Resolve any underlying  errors that may still occur during the balance update process despite the latest Helius RPC integration for balance display.
-   Verify the end-to-end functionality of joining a paid arena room, ensuring the Privy transaction confirmation UI appears correctly and the SOL transfer to the platform wallet is successful.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the persistent issue of the landing page displaying /bin/bash.00 and 0.0000 SOL despite the user being authenticated and their Privy modal showing a correct balance (e.g., 0.1 SOL). This problem resurfaced after a fix for the Privy transaction UI not appearing was implemented.

The  function has been updated to use the correct Privy v3.0  hook:

This change aimed to resolve the Something went wrong error during transaction attempts.

For balance display, the AI previously (Message 460-482) re-integrated direct Helius RPC calls to fetch user balances using the user-provided API key (). This involved using  and . The AI believed this would resolve the discrepancy. However, the user's latest feedback (Message 499) indicates the problem persists, suggesting a conflict or incorrect implementation of this balance fetching. The AI's last action in the trajectory (Message 504) is investigating the  function's dependency array, indicating an active debug of the balance display logic.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and fix why the landing page displays /bin/bash.00 SOL for authenticated users, ensuring it reflects the real Privy wallet balance as per user request.
