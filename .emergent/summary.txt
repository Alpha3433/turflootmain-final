The previous AI engineerâ€™s work on TurfLoot primarily focused on enhancing the mobile user experience without compromising the desktop version. Initial efforts addressed deployment issues and backend logic. A significant portion of the trajectory involved implementing mobile responsiveness, including virtual joysticks, adaptive HUD, safe area handling, and an orientation gate. A recurring challenge was persistent mobile detection failure on iOS, which was eventually resolved with proper Privy credentials. Subsequent updates refined mobile scrolling, introduced a non-invasive mobile lobby/friends button, reorganized mobile layout, and overhauled the in-game HUD for a touch-optimized experience. The current phase is heavily focused on debugging and perfecting the in-game mobile joystick functionality, which remains partially broken despite multiple iterative fixes and extensive debugging efforts, along with refining touch targets for other interactive elements like cash-out and leaderboard buttons.

TurfLoot, an Agario-style real-time multiplayer game with Solana and Privy.io integration, aims for a highly responsive mobile experience while preserving desktop functionality. Key requirements included resolving deployment issues, refining the landing page (removing Join Game, implementing mobile vertical scrolling, adding a mobile-only lobby/friends button, removing Recent Wins and Game Features, and reordering mobile layout). For the in-game screen, mobile-only features like joysticks, action buttons, toast-style mission notifications, a circular/collapsible minimap, collapsible stats/leaderboard panels, removal of Ping/FPS, mobile-specific auto-hiding instructions, iOS safe area support, orientation gate, and grey border fix were crucial. The lobby system needed mobile condensation, and Privy authentication required fixing. Current focus is on refining the in-game mobile HUD to remove clutter (mission popups, error banners), further shrink/collapse the minimap, reposition info icons, fix text scaling, ensure joystick movement, and ensure all buttons respond reliably.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on debugging a critical issue where the in-game mobile joystick's visual knob moves, but the player character in the game does not respond. This followed several iterations of fixing mobile UI elements, including:
*   Redesigning the  for a modern look and removing clutter.
*   Refining the in-game HUD: removing gas/lightning buttons, shrinking the minimap, making mission popups toast-style, repositioning the info icon, and hiding error banners.
*   Enlarging touch targets for the cash-out and leaderboard/trophy buttons, and repositioning the joystick.
*   Fixing the trophy button's 500 server error and the cash-out button's unintended inner progress ring.

The joystick issue has been particularly challenging. Initially, the joystick wasn't working at all, then it started moving visually but didn't control the player. The AI implemented a new, simplified joystick system (Chat 385), which resolved a Wrong pointer ID, ignoring issue (Chat 391). After this fix, the joystick knob moves visually, but the player character still doesn't. The AI has now added intensive game movement debugging (Chat 403) to , which includes analyzing the game object structure, player properties (x, y, vx, vy, dir), and testing 7 different movement approaches simultaneously with detailed logging. The latest screenshot shows an active multiplayer game with the debug system ready.

Analyze the detailed console logs from the intensive joystick movement debugging provided by the user to identify why the player character is not moving.
