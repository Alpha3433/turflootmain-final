The AI engineer's trajectory focused heavily on mobile UI/UX and in-game experience for the TurfLoot application, iteratively responding to user feedback. Key accomplishments include implementing a mobile landscape orientation enforcement with a custom modal, then integrating loading states and refining the detection logic. The engineer then optimized the in-game canvas for full-screen display and ensured the virtual analog stick was fully functional across orientations, disabling touch-to-move. Extensive work was done to fix the mobile landing page's landscape layout by refining mobile detection. In-game UI elements like the minimap, leaderboard, and stats panel were re-designed for compactness and user-friendliness on mobile, including expandable views and notch-safe positioning. Further fixes addressed a button text selection bug and refined the mobile split mechanic to utilize joystick direction. The latest task involves simplifying the redesigned stats panel for improved minimalism.

The TurfLoot application is an Agar.io-style multiplayer game with a military theme, using Hathora for game servers and Privy for wallet/authentication. The goal is to enhance the MVP with UI/UX improvements, bug fixes, and social features, prioritizing the mobile experience.

**Implemented features include:**
*   **UI/UX**: Mobile layout redesigned (vertical stack: WALLET, CUSTOMIZE, LEADERBOARD, PARTY). Character customization updated with blue circular avatar and scroll-based eye-tracking. In-game mobile buttons (CASH OUT, SPLIT) optimized.
*   **Social System**: Persistent friends/party system, mobile PARTY panel aligned with desktop.
*   **Mobile Parity**: Full mobile support, including a virtual in-game joystick.
*   **Game Mechanics**: Agar.io splitting, ejection, merging, real-time Time Alive, cash-out.
*   **Bug Fixes**: Solana deposit fixes, Privy login issues,  modal delay fixed,  implemented, mobile background reset fixed, mobile WITHDRAW button authentication popup removed.
*   **User Interaction**: Dynamic player name on mobile navigation bar.

**Problem/Current Development:** The ongoing task involves continuously refining the mobile in-game experience to be intuitive and non-intrusive. Specifically, the stats panel needs to be redesigned for a more simplistic, space-saving display in its bottom-center mobile position.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main client-side landing page, handling UI, authentication, and pre-game interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Implemented mobile landscape orientation enforcement, including  checks,  function, and  state for an informational modal.
        -   Removed  state and associated loading modal, integrating loading feedback directly into the orientation modal.
        -   Refined mobile detection logic for both portrait and landscape, moving from  to more robust checks ( user agent,  for landscape).
        -   Ensured all game entry points (e.g., LOCAL PRACTICE) trigger the orientation check.
        -   Fixed mobile layout in landscape to maintain vertical stacking using CSS media queries.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles the core in-game experience, including rendering, movement, and player actions.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Enhanced  detection for in-game context to ensure joystick and other mobile-specific features activate correctly in landscape.
        -   Ensured the virtual joystick is visible and functional in all mobile orientations, disabling canvas-based touch-to-move.
        -   Implemented various fixes for analog stick movement, including addressing timing issues where the joystick was used before the game fully initialized and correcting the  reference.
        -   Optimized in-game UI elements for mobile: minimap (scaled down then up), leaderboard (compact Top 3 with expand/auto-collapse, notch-safe positioning), and stats panel (2-line summary with expand/auto-collapse, repositioned to bottom-center).
        -   Repositioned CASH OUT and SPLIT buttons for right-thumb accessibility in landscape, aligning them horizontally with the analog stick.
        -   Fixed a mobile bug where holding CASH OUT/SPLIT buttons would highlight emojis by applying  and .
        -   Updated the mobile split mechanic to propel smaller cells in the direction of the joystick, fixing an issue where it was defaulting to mouse world coordinates.
        -   Performed an initial visual redesign of the stats panel for a modern, polished look.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines the root layout and metadata for the Next.js application.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on redesigning the in-game mobile stats panel. Following a previous user request to make the stats panel more visually appealing and polished in its bottom-center position (which resulted in a Modern Design Elements implementation with gradients, shadows, glass effects, etc.), the user provided feedback that this design was too elaborate and takes up too much visual space.

Therefore, the current work is to revert to a more minimalistic and compact design for the mobile stats panel. The AI engineer has just initiated this task by making an edit to simplify the overall container styling, and the next immediate step is to simplify the header styling as part of this new minimalist approach.
