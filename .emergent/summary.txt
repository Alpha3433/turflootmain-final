The AI engineer's trajectory primarily focused on migrating the TurfLoot game from Hathora to Colyseus and debugging critical issues. Initial work involved resolving environment-related problems and client-side connection logic. The first major identified problem was a  vs  property mismatch in , leading to  and  for session tracking. This was fixed after multiple attempts due to caching issues requiring forced rebuilds. Once session tracking was verified, the next critical issue emerged: the Server Browser displayed 0 Active Rooms even when sessions were active. This led to debugging . The debugging process uncovered several issues within this API: incorrect database query paths (e.g.,  instead of ), a missing  field filter, inconsistent collection names ( vs ), and the  not being stored in the session document by the  endpoint. The engineer attempted various fixes, including extending the session activity window and adding extensive debugging. The most recent finding confirms that while players *are* being matched into the same Colyseus room, the Server Browser still fails to list these active rooms, indicating a persistent problem with the  endpoint's ability to fetch and display available games.

<product_requirements>
The TurfLoot application is an Agar.io-style, military-themed multiplayer game built on Next.js. The core objective is a complete migration from Hathora to Colyseus Cloud for authoritative server-side game logic with a 20 Hz tick rate. Key features include a dynamic Server Browser for room discovery, Solana wallet integration (Privy, Helius API), and efficient Colyseus room management. The Next.js frontend uses the Colyseus client SDK for seamless room joining, player input, and game state synchronization. Bots are to be removed from paid and server browser multiplayer games to ensure real player competition. The architecture comprises a dedicated  for Colyseus game logic and a  for the Next.js UI. So far, Colyseus connectivity, game state synchronization, and the foundation for a matchmaking system (joining/creating rooms) have been established. Recent efforts aimed to stabilize room pooling and player session tracking, specifically addressing  errors due to incorrect room ID handling and ensuring active rooms are visible in the Server Browser.

**Detailed File Summaries & Changes:**

-   : Configures Next.js startup.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Client-side game logic, Colyseus connection, player session tracking, bot management.
    -   **Changes**: Initial fix of  to  within  (line 897, later also line 891) to correctly send the Colyseus room identifier. Added extensive  for debugging room properties and session data payload.
-   : Colyseus client SDK helper.
    -   **Importance**: Manages Colyseus client connections, room joining (prioritizes ).
    -   **Changes**: Improved error logging and connection timeouts.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: API endpoint for listing active Colyseus rooms for the Server Browser.
    -   **Changes**: Multiple iterations of fixes:
        -   Changed database field access from  to  and  to  to match flat session structure.
        -   Removed incorrect  filter from MongoDB query.
        -   Corrected MongoDB collection name from  to .
        -   Increased  window from 2 to 10 minutes.
        -   Added extensive debugging  to trace query execution and results.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: API endpoint for tracking player session lifecycle (join, update, leave).
    -   **Changes**: Added  to debug the  being stored in the database, verifying  presence.
-    (newly created):
    -   **Importance**: Temporary API endpoint created to directly test the database query logic of .
    -   **Changes**: Contains a simplified version of the  query.
-    (newly created):
    -   **Importance**: Temporary API endpoint created to verify MongoDB connection and simple query.
    -   **Changes**: Basic MongoDB query test.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Ensure the  endpoint correctly queries the MongoDB  collection to list active Colyseus rooms with accurate player counts.
- Verify that the Server Browser UI displays the JOIN option for existing active rooms instead of only CREATE rooms.
- Implement a mechanism to keep player sessions actively updated in the database while they are playing, preventing rooms from becoming stale.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively troubleshooting why the Server Browser was not displaying active rooms for other players to join, despite the underlying Colyseus multiplayer room pooling appearing to function correctly. The logs confirmed that players *were* successfully joining the same Colyseus rooms (e.g.,  and ), and client-side session tracking was working with no  errors.

The primary focus of the current work is debugging the  endpoint. This API is responsible for fetching active game sessions from MongoDB and presenting them as joinable rooms in the Server Browser.

The following issues related to the  endpoint have been identified and partially addressed, but the problem persists:
1.  **Incorrect Database Field Paths**: Initial queries used  and , which were corrected to  and  to match the flat database schema.
2.  **Missing  Filter**: An incorrect filter for a non-existent  field was removed from the database query.
3.  **Collection Name Inconsistency**: The API was using  instead of the correct  collection name. This was fixed.
4.  **Session Expiration Window**: The  timestamp window was increased from 2 to 10 minutes to prevent premature session expiry.
5.  ** Missing in Stored Session**: Debugging revealed that the  was not consistently being stored in the  collection itself, preventing the  query from finding rooms by their .

Despite these fixes, the Server Browser still only shows CREATE ROOM and fails to list active games. The AI engineer is at the point of confirming that players are indeed in the same room, but the discovery mechanism through  is the bottleneck. The current state is that the internal game logic for multiplayer connection is sound, but the external presentation of joinable rooms is broken.

<optional_next_step>
Test the  endpoint immediately after a user creates a new game to diagnose why active sessions aren't being retrieved.
