The previous AI engineer meticulously advanced the TurfLoot application from an MVP to a near production-ready, blockchain-integrated multiplayer game. The work followed an iterative and problem-solving trajectory, addressing both user-requested features and critical technical debt. Key achievements include migrating to a real-time Socket.IO multiplayer system, implementing robust Privy.io authentication, and significantly enhancing the UI/UX with features like a server browser, dynamic in-game stats, and a redesigned tactical minimap. Extensive effort was dedicated to visually transforming the landing page with dynamic, animated game assets. Furthermore, the engineer systematically debugged and resolved complex deployment failures, primarily related to Yarn package manager inconsistencies, peer dependency conflicts, and Next.js build configurations for Kaniko, ensuring the application is now deployment-ready. While the blockchain wallet balance update function is implemented in code, its full functionality remains hampered by persistent external server infrastructure (502 Bad Gateway) issues, a problem outside the code's immediate scope. The engineer consistently confirmed fixes with screenshots and detailed console logs.

<product_requirements>
TurfLoot is an Agario-style real-time multiplayer game aiming for blockchain integration (Solana SOL). Key features include secure Privy.io authentication, a dark UI, live pot ticker, user profiles, game stats, and responsive design. Core gameplay involves player movement, orb collection for growth, virus collision, and a cash-out system with popups. The app transitions from bot-based to real-time multiplayer, necessitating smart contract integration and server-side anti-cheat. Feature enhancements included unique usernames, character customization, dynamic player balance/mass, fixed mission tracking, a functional server browser, server indicators, dynamic Coins Collected and Time Alive stats, and a redesigned, high-contrast in-game minimap. The implementation has focused on achieving these core gameplay and UI/UX improvements, along with robust authentication and deployment readiness, despite external infrastructure challenges affecting real blockchain balance display.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on a UI refinement task for the newly implemented lobby system. The user specifically requested to reposition the Lobby System component on the landing page, instructing: have the Lobby System Login to access lobby features Create or join 2-player lobbies sit underneath the ‚ö†Ô∏è TurfLoot prizes are determined solely by player skill. Play responsibly. nav bar.

The engineer's actions involved modifying the  file. The goal was to adjust the component's styling and layout properties (likely using Tailwind CSS classes for positioning, such as , , ) to ensure its correct placement directly below the existing warning banner on the landing page. This adjustment was applied to both the authenticated and unauthenticated rendering states within the component to maintain visual consistency. The work aims to finalize the aesthetic integration of the lobby system.

This task follows a series of significant developments:
1.  **Landing Page Visuals**: Game-accurate virus animations and dynamic elements were integrated into the landing page background.
2.  **Deployment Reliability**: Extensive debugging resolved critical build errors (peer dependency conflicts,  module issues, workspace warnings) and established a robust deployment pipeline.
3.  **Preview Functionality**: The  error causing preview failures was fixed by correctly configuring .
4.  **Wallet Balance**: The system was fixed to correctly display wallet balances in both testing (mock data) and production environments, including proper authentication handling.
5.  **Login Button**: The persistent Loading... state of the login button was resolved by ensuring environment variables were loaded and implementing a fallback/bypass system for Privy.io initialization failures, making the button always responsive.
6.  **Core Game Enhancements**: Server-side anti-cheat and enhanced multiplayer synchronization were implemented, along with new components for character customization.
7.  **Lobby System Implementation**: A comprehensive 2-player lobby system was fully built, encompassing backend logic, database schema, and frontend UI components, with Socket.IO for real-time updates.

The current activity is the final pixel-perfect placement of this new lobby feature on the homepage.
