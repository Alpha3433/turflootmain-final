The AI engineer's work involved an iterative process of debugging and feature implementation for the TurfLoot application. Initially, the focus was on rectifying a critical Privy Solana deposit issue, which led to numerous refactorings of the  function in  and  due to deprecated Privy hooks and incorrect configuration. This phase included battling SSR issues, dependency conflicts, and accurately configuring Solana mainnet details.

Subsequently, the engineer implemented real-time Solana balance monitoring using Helius RPC, including robust error handling and a multi-endpoint failover system. A 10% deposit fee mechanism was added, automatically transferring fees to a designated site wallet. Critical bug fixes followed, addressing a non-functional Privy login button (due to an invalid app ID) and game buttons showing authentication popups (fixed by using proper Privy hooks). Finally, a paid rooms feature with insufficient funds notification was developed, and a significant performance bottleneck in the CREATE PARTY modal (caused by a slow  API call and MongoDB  errors) was resolved by implementing asynchronous loading. The trajectory concluded with the user requesting a mobile layout redesign.

<product_requirements>
The TurfLoot application is an Agar.io-style multiplayer game with a military theme, leveraging Hathora for game servers and Privy for wallet and authentication. The core objective is to enhance the existing MVP through UI/UX improvements, bug fixes, and robust social features.

**Currently Implemented Features:**
*   **UI/UX**: Refined navigation, scrollable User Profile Modal.
*   **Social System**: Persistent friends system (requests, acceptance), comprehensive party system (public/private creation, friend invitations, invite management, real-time notification badges).
*   **Mobile Parity**: Full mobile support across social, wallet, leaderboard, and game controls.
*   **Game Mechanics**: Authentic Agar.io splitting, directional ejection, and merging.
*   **Bug Fixes**: Resolved random eliminations and premature game over popups.
*   **In-Game Metrics**: Real-time Time Alive metric that stops on cash-out.
*   **Cash-Out Visualization**: A subtle, non-intrusive visual cash-out progress ring in-game.

**Immediate Problem Addressed & Solutions Implemented:**
The Solana-only deposit functionality via Privy was broken, specifically the DEPOSIT SOL button failed to trigger the Privy funding modal. This has been fixed to use Privy v2.24.0's  hook with correct Solana Mainnet () configuration and fallbacks.
Real-time Solana balance monitoring using Helius RPC was implemented, displaying current SOL and USD values. A 10% deposit fee, sent to a site-owned SOL wallet, is now automatically applied. Authentication issues with the green LOGIN button (due to an invalid Privy App ID) and game buttons displaying authentication popups for logged-in users (due to legacy bridge usage) have been resolved. A paid rooms system checks user wallet balance against game stakes and displays an insufficient funds banner. The 20-second delay in opening the CREATE PARTY modal was fixed by making friends list loading asynchronous.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Central client-side component for UI, authentication, state, and wallet interactions. It contains the core game logic,  function, and real-time balance display.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file underwent extensive modifications.  was refactored numerous times to correctly use  from  with Solana-specific  configuration and multi-tier fallbacks. Real-time Solana balance monitoring was implemented, including  with Helius RPC integration, error handling, and  to update  state. A 10% deposit fee calculation and processing logic were added. Authentication checks for  and game buttons were updated to use Privy's  state and hooks, replacing legacy  logic. Insufficient funds notification banner logic and rendering were added.  calls were made asynchronous to improve CREATE PARTY modal opening speed. Several syntax errors and state management issues ( definition,  state) were fixed here.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Provides the Privy authentication context and global configurations for wallet and authentication.
    -   **Changes Made**: Heavily modified to configure Solana wallet connectors, enforcing Solana-only wallet creation ().  was updated to include Solana Mainnet with  and , and later  for specific API calls, though the final Solana funding uses  parameter directly. Invalid  was added and then removed. The  was updated here via  changes.

<pending_tasks>
- Mobile Customization Screen Redesign
- Modernizing Social Popup
- Production Infrastructure Stability: Address persistent 502/404/ERR_ABORTED errors on preview deployment for  calls. (Note: The MongoDB  error found during CREATE PARTY modal fix might be related to this, but it was not fully addressed as a pending task here).
- Implement  button functionality in the Wallet Snapshot.
- Mobile layout redesign to vertical stacking for LEADERBOARD, WALLET, PARTY, CUSTOMIZE sections.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with redesigning the mobile layout of the TurfLoot application. The user explicitly requested to change the current 2x2 grid layout of the LEADERBOARD, WALLET, PARTY, and CUSTOMIZE sections on mobile to a cleaner vertical stacked layout, similar to a reference application (damnbruh), while ensuring the desktop version remains unchanged.

The AI engineer acknowledged the request, confirmed understanding by comparing the existing TurfLoot mobile layout (4 boxes in a 2x2 grid) with the desired vertical stacked layout. The immediate next action was to locate the relevant code sections responsible for rendering these four UI components on mobile to begin implementing the vertical stacking. This involved initiating a search within the codebase for the mobile layout code that controls these specific sections. The engineer had not yet made any code changes for this task and was in the initial exploration phase.
