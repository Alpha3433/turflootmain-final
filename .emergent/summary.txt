The AI engineer's work largely focused on an iterative redesign and functional refinement of the TurfLoot landing page (). Initially, the challenge was resolving broken styling, attributed to CSS compilation and hydration issues. The solution shifted from external CSS to extensive inline styles and client-side rendering with  for animations. The core task involved implementing multiple user-requested design themes (Modern Minimalist, Gaming Interface, Space/Cosmic, Modern Glass/Neumorphism, Retro Gaming/Synthwave, and most recently, Military/Tactical). Each theme required full page rewrites, preserving core functionality. Subsequent tasks addressed visual glitches like background refreshing, non-functional buttons, military lingo reversion, mock data removal, and intricate panel positioning/sizing to achieve a symmetric and integrated desktop layout. The process was driven by continuous user feedback and screenshot-based verification.

<product_requirements>
TurfLoot is an Agar.io-style global multiplayer game requiring Hathora integration for servers, a 2-player Party Lobby, dynamic leaderboards, and Privy wallet display. Key non-functional requirements include real-time latency, mobile optimization, and UI/UX improvements like resized popups and synchronized social features. Spectator mode was removed, replaced by global multiplayer. The initial problem was a broken landing page UI, which evolved into multiple redesigns: modern minimalist, gaming interface, space/cosmic (animated backgrounds, mobile), modern glass/neumorphism, retro gaming/synthwave, and currently, a military/tactical theme. All redesigns strictly required preserving existing functionality, buttons, and icons. Recent user requests have focused on refining the Military/Tactical theme's aesthetics, including background animations, layout optimization, text revisions, mock data removal, and precise panel positioning/sizing.

<key_technical_concepts>
- Next.js 14 (App Router, Server/Client Components)
- React Hooks (, , )
- Inline Styles (for reliable rendering, bypassing CSS issues)
- Hathora (multiplayer game server hosting)
- MongoDB (database)
- Privy (wallet/authentication, later mocked)
- Tailwind CSS (initially problematic, mostly bypassed for UI)
- PostCSS (CSS processing, source of initial build errors)

- ****: The primary file undergoing extensive modifications.
    - **Importance**: Serves as the landing page, handling UI display, game stats, stake selection, and user interactions.
    - **Changes**: This file has been iteratively updated for multiple design themes, including Military/Tactical. It contains all inline styles for the current theme, animation logic (,  for stable random values), dynamic text updates (username), button event handlers (stake selection, username confirmation), panel positioning and sizing logic, and the removal of mock data. Crucially, fixes for initial CSS issues,  dependency removal, and hydration errors were implemented here.
- ****: Global CSS styles.
    - **Importance**: Defines base styles and imports Tailwind CSS.
    - **Changes**: Minimal recent changes, primarily to ensure  backgrounds are dark to prevent white outlines after background extension.
- ****: Manages Next.js dependencies.
    - **Importance**: Records project dependencies.
    - **Changes**:  was removed.

<pending_tasks>
- Mobile Customization Screen Redesign (not touched)
- Modernizing Social Popup (not touched)
- Production Infrastructure Stability: Address persistent 502/404/ERR_ABORTED errors on preview deployment for  calls (partially addressed by fixing build and API endpoint dependencies).
- The very last uncompleted task: Make the SERVER BROWSER box the same dimensions as the WALLET box.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was meticulously refining the desktop layout of the Military/Tactical themed landing page, specifically focusing on the positioning and sizing of the four main panels: SERVER BROWSER, PARTY, WALLET, and CUSTOMIZE. The user's explicit request was to move these panels closer inwards to frame the central game controls and stats. The AI adjusted the  and  CSS properties for all panels from  to . However, this change unintentionally moved the panels further apart from the center. Upon user feedback, the AI corrected this by moving them much closer inward, setting the  and  properties to  for better proximity to the central elements. This resulted in a focused and integrated layout. The very last instruction received from the user, and the task the AI engineer is currently preparing to address, is to have the SERVER BROWSER box be the same dimensions as the WALLET box. This involves resizing the SERVER BROWSER panel's width from 300px to 280px to match the WALLET box, further contributing to the visual consistency and symmetry of the panel layout.
