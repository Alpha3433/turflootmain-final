The AI engineer's work primarily focused on transforming the TurfLoot application into a robust, Hathora-first multiplayer game. Initial efforts involved systematic debugging and refactoring of the server browser, API integrations, MongoDB connectivity, and Hathora client. Critical fixes included eliminating local game fallbacks, implementing CDN-based ping, restoring wallet functionality via Helius API, and correcting Hathora WebSocket connection logic. Despite intermittent claims of everything working, a persistent WebSocket connection error and UI indicator remained. This led the user to request a full multiplayer overhaul based on authoritative server logic. The AI engineer initiated this overhaul by refactoring core game initialization and the server browser to directly integrate with Hathora rooms, but immediately hit a  error, halting progress on the new architecture.

<product_requirements>
The TurfLoot application is an Agar.io-style military-themed multiplayer game, leveraging Hathora for game servers and Privy for authentication, targeting both mobile and desktop. The goal is to enhance MVP functionality through UI/UX improvements, bug fixes, and social features.

**Implemented features & fixes:**
*   **Redesigned Server Browser:** Functional modal with condensed information, stake filters, region flags, dynamic player counts, CDN-based client-side ping (cached, color-coded, auto-sorting), and Hathora room creation/joining (empty servers collapse into Create New Room).
*   **Wallet Functionality:** Fixed via Helius API key integration, improved wallet detection, and real SOL balance display.
*   **Hathora Integration:** Refactored for robust room creation, correct region mapping, authenticated WebSocket connection, and removal of all local server fallbacks. Includes loading modals and retry logic.
*   **Enhanced Loading Popup:** Displays for 5+ seconds with progressive status updates, real-time progress bar, detailed server info, and success confirmation.

**Current Overhaul Requirements:**
*   **Authoritative Hathora Rooms:** All game logic server-side.
*   **Server Browser-First:** Direct load into online matches; no local mode. List active rooms, pre-warmed rooms, then create new room options. Display stake, region, players, ping, join/spectate.
*   **Room Lifecycle:** On-demand creation, 8-minute keep-alive, pre-warm 1 room per popular region/tier during peak hours.
*   **Networking:** WebSocket transport (Hathora), 20 Hz tick rate.
*   **Spectator & Party Support:** Spectate option if â‰¥1 player. Party system for group joins.
*   **Backend Monitoring:** Hathora Console metrics.
*   **Exclusion:** Server-side bot management for auto-fill is *not* required; practice bots remain unchanged.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently engaged in a complete overhaul of the TurfLoot application's multiplayer experience to ensure 100% Hathora integration and a server browser-first approach, eliminating all local game fallbacks. This work began by refactoring the core game initialization in  and  to be entirely Hathora-dependent and authoritative.

Simultaneously, the  component is being updated to directly display and interact with real Hathora rooms instead of simulated server data. This involves replacing old state variables (like  with ), updating the data fetching logic to query for actual Hathora rooms, and adjusting the UI rendering to categorize and display  and . The  function in the modal was also modified to align with the new Hathora room structure.

The immediate blocker and the last identified issue is a **critical JavaScript error**:  within . This error occurred after recent refactoring efforts to update the server browser, causing the component to crash and preventing any further progress on the multiplayer overhaul. Before this, there were also persistent  errors and Privy bridge not yet available messages, which while noted, are secondary to the current blocking error.
