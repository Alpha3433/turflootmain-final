The AI engineer successfully transitioned the TurfLoot game from an MVP to a more refined state. The work primarily focused on resolving critical UI/UX issues, enhancing mobile responsiveness, and implementing new gameplay features. Key phases included an extensive overhaul of the customization system, where Hats and Upgrade Rarity functionalities were completely removed, and a clean component was established for managing skins. This phase also introduced visual skin previews, fixed UI clipping, and ensured equipped items persisted across sessions and reflected in the game and character preview. Subsequently, mission rewards were adjusted and integrated with a persistent player coin economy, including a new API endpoint. The lobby system was removed, game mechanics like virus count and player speed were adjusted to be more Agario-like, and a mobile leaderboard bug was fixed. The current work involves implementing a comprehensive Split mechanic, a core Agar.io feature, encompassing configuration, state, player cell structure, and input handling for both desktop and mobile, which is still in progress.

<product_requirements>
TurfLoot, an Agario-style real-time multiplayer game, required significant mobile optimization and feature expansion. The initial application needed functional mobile joysticks, action buttons, mission notifications, a circular/collapsible minimap, mobile-specific stat/leaderboard panels, and an orientation gate. Prior work had fixed joysticks, repositioned UI, decluttered elements, redesigned popups, and implemented dynamic zoom.

This trajectory's explicit requirements focused on:
1.  **Mobile UI Refinements**: Less intensive dynamic zoom, redesigned popups (showing earnings/position, later removing mass), iterative minimap size adjustments, and ensuring mobile-specific features load correctly.
2.  **Player Experience**: Displaying player's waged balance above character, removing player eliminated kill feed, and fixing mission tracking's first-load race condition.
3.  **Customization System Overhaul**: Redesigning the Change Appearance modal for mobile-friendliness, managing skins (removing Plasma Storm, Crystal Prism, adding Rainbow Hologram, Chrome Steel, Matte Blue, and setting a basic default collection), completely removing the Hats category, and removing upgrade rarity functionality.
4.  **In-Game Economy & UI**: Adjusting mission rewards (to 115, 130, 900, 200 coins for Collect, Survive, Eliminate, Mass respectively) with persistence to player accounts, adding a coins display to the landing page navigation bar, and having the coin balance start at 0 for new accounts with dynamic updates.
5.  **Core Game Mechanics**: Removing the Lobby System, adding more green spikes/viruses, lowering player movement speed, and fixing a mobile leaderboard error.
6.  **New Core Gameplay Feature**: Implementing a comprehensive Agar.io-style Split mechanic for both desktop and mobile, with detailed rules for eligibility, mass division, projection, max cells, cooldowns, merge locks, and UI/UX.
