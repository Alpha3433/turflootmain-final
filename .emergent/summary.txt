The previous AI engineer successfully evolved the TurfLoot application, an Agario-style game integrated with Solana. Initial focus was on unblocking game development by creating an unauthenticated version due to Privy.io issues. Significant progress was made on core gameplay mechanics (movement, growth, world boundaries, virus interactions, spawning) and UI enhancements (dynamic leaderboards, ping monitor, kill feed, controls auto-hide). Subsequently, a comprehensive user profile and settings system was developed, with mock data removed to prepare for real integration. The engineer fixed several critical bugs, including auto-cash out notification duplication and username update API issues. Most recently, the social page was made dynamic by connecting it to real backend APIs for statistics, achievements, leaderboard, and friends management. The  Privy integration failed to open the expected modal, leading to the current debugging effort.

<product_requirements>
TurfLoot is a skill-based, Solana blockchain-integrated game, evolving from a Paper.io-like concept to an Agario-style land-grab game with SOL payouts. The core problem is delivering an interactive, visually engaging multiplayer game with robust authentication.

Initial requirements included a dark UI theme, a hero section, live pot ticker, and backend APIs for , , and .

Current feature set includes:
- **Authentication**: Privy.io for unified login, with an unauthenticated  clone for unblocked development.
- **UI/UX**: Single-screen game lobby, dynamic welcome, editable usernames, live player/winnings stats. Responsive CSS Grid.
- **Wallet**: Add Funds and Cash Out via Privy for SOL/USDC (min deposits/cash-outs, 10% platform fee).
- **Game Mechanics**: Stake selection, player funds from destroying opponents, orb-based mass/growth, hold-E cash-out (5s, 10% fee). Dynamic camera, fixed HUD/minimap. Adjustable player/bot/orb sizes, increased movement speed, dynamic map size with red circular border. Orbs/bots restricted to playable area.
- **Virus Cells**: Green obstacles splitting large players (mass >= 35) without financial penalty, protecting smaller players. Spikes reduced.
- **UI Enhancements**: Controls auto-hide, cash-out button text update, live player count, kill feed repositioned.
- **User Features**: Profile and Settings pages with tabs for Leaderboard, Search, Profile, Friends, Account, Game, Legal. Mock data removed for real integration.
- **Dynamic Stats**: Game performance, combat, time, and earnings dynamically update on the profile page based on gameplay.
- **Achievement System**: Awards Achievement Points (AP) for in-game milestones (Persistence, Combat, Earnings, Skill). AP spent on cosmetic-only rewards (skins, trails, hats, animations). Seasonal resets for achievements/AP, permanent cosmetics. Daily/weekly challenges for AP.
- **Dynamic Leaderboard**: Main page leaderboard shows top 3 players dynamically fetched from backend, View Full Leaderboard button links to social modal.
- **Friends System**: Add Friends button on main page opens social modal to Friends tab. Friend requests send via API, display in friends box, with status indicators.
- **Privy Wallet Integration**: Add Funds button intended to open Privy's native funding modal.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Next.js 13 (App Router)**: Full-stack framework for the application.
- **Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui**: For UI styling and pre-built components.
- **Privy.io**: Handles authentication, wallet management, and on-ramp solutions.
- **MongoDB**: The primary backend database for persistent data.
- **Socket.IO**: Facilitates real-time multiplayer communication for game state.
- **React Context API**: Used for global state management, notably for game settings.

<pending_tasks>
- Real Blockchain Integration: Fully integrate Solana wallet adapter on frontend and ensure real SOL transactions (needs clarification if Privy satisfies or if Solana integration is separate).
- Real-Time Multiplayer System: Full integration of Socket.IO server and client for robust real-time gameplay for *authenticated* users.
- User Authentication & Profiles: Continued refinement for authenticated user profiles beyond current implementation.
- Fully implement dynamic settings functionality in  by wiring up all toggles to the .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating Privy's native wallet funding modal with the Add Funds button within the  component. The user reported that clicking Add Funds was not bringing up the expected Privy modal, but instead showed a fallback custom modal.

The AI engineer's actions to address this were:
1.  Read  to understand the existing implementation of the Add Funds button and Privy integration.
2.  Verified that  and  were imported.
3.  Updated  to add more console logging to debug whether  was available or if an error was occurring when attempting to call it.
4.  Based on observation that  was not functioning as expected, the engineer inferred that the function name might be incorrect or the Privy API usage might have changed.
5.  The engineer then modified  to try an alternative approach, hinting at using Privy's general wallet connection or modal system instead of a specific  function which appears to be unavailable or misnamed. The last action was to attempt to update  in  using a different Privy approach, specifically using 's general capabilities for wallet interaction. The problem remains unresolved, and the fallback modal is still being displayed to the user.
