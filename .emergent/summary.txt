The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enhancing the TurfLoot mobile gaming experience. Initially, the core problem of the mobile joystick not controlling the player character was debugged and resolved by correcting the player object reference ( to ) and addressing a critical timing/scope issue within the game loop. Following this, extensive mobile UI/UX improvements were implemented: repositioning the trophy button, shrinking the minimap, redesigning live events for mobile, removing distracting elements (info emoji, multiplayer status, mission icon toggle, Mission Failed! text), and redesigning game over/tab closed popups to be minimal and mobile-friendly. Finally, a dynamic zoom feature was added for mobile, adjusting the camera based on player size. The approach involved iterative debugging, direct file modifications, and screenshot testing, always ensuring desktop functionality remained unchanged.

TurfLoot, an Agario-style real-time multiplayer game with Solana and Privy.io integration, aims for a highly responsive and optimized mobile experience while preserving desktop functionality. The initial goal was to resolve deployment issues and refine the landing page, including mobile vertical scrolling, a mobile-only lobby/friends button, and reordering mobile layout. For the in-game screen (), critical mobile-only features included functional joysticks, action buttons, toast-style mission notifications, a circular/collapsible minimap, collapsible stats/leaderboard panels, removal of Ping/FPS, mobile-specific auto-hiding instructions, iOS safe area support, and an orientation gate. The lobby system needed mobile condensation, and Privy authentication required fixing.

The work completed in this trajectory focused heavily on:
1.  **Fixing Mobile Joystick:** Ensuring the in-game mobile joystick accurately controls the player character.
2.  **UI Elements Repositioning:** Adjusting the trophy/leaderboard button, cash-out button, and minimap placement to avoid iOS notches and overlaps.
3.  **UI Decluttering:** Removing the central info emoji, multiplayer status panel, mission icon toggle, and Mission Failed! floating text from the mobile view.
4.  **Popup Redesign:** Making the Eliminated by... and Tab Closed popups more mobile-friendly, compact, and visually appealing.
5.  **Mission Display:** Moving and optimizing the mission display to the top-center of the mobile screen.
6.  **Dynamic Camera:** Implementing a dynamic zoom-out feature on mobile as the player grows.
All changes were strictly for the mobile experience, with desktop functionality explicitly preserved.

    -   **Summary**: The core in-game screen, handling game logic, rendering, and all real-time UI/UX elements. This file underwent extensive modifications.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Joystick Fixes**: Corrected player object access from  to  in joystick event handlers (, , ) and the main game loop to ensure the joystick modifies the correct object instance. Added safety checks for player object existence.
        -   **Orientation Gate**: Improved mobile detection and orientation logic to ensure the  correctly hides in landscape mode.
        -   **Trophy Button**: Repositioned multiple times: initially moved right for iOS notch, then moved back to the left, vertically aligned with the joystick (using  and ). Enhanced error handling to prevent crashes.
        -   **Minimap**: Reduced size on mobile twice: first to 100px diameter (50% smaller), then to 25px diameter (another 75% smaller), and finally repositioned to  (top-left) to avoid overlap with the cash-out button.
        -   **Info Emoji**: Removed the central info emoji (ℹ️) from the mobile experience.
        -   **Multiplayer Status & Mission Icon Toggle**: Removed both elements from the mobile UI to clean up the right edge of the screen.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully implemented **dynamic in-game zoom for mobile users**. This feature causes the camera to automatically zoom out as the player character grows in mass, providing a more strategic and encompassing view of the game world for larger players, while maintaining a closer, more precise view for smaller players. This was achieved by modifying the camera rendering logic in  to calculate a  based on , applying this only when  is true.

The trajectory concluded with this task, confirming that:
-   Small players (10-50 mass) maintain a 1.2x zoom.
-   Medium players (50-200 mass) get 0.8-1.0x zoom.
-   Large players (200+ mass) experience 0.4-0.6x zoom.

This enhancement significantly improves the mobile gameplay experience by adapting the view to the player's current size, thus making the game more playable on smaller screens at all stages of growth. All previous mobile UI enhancements, including the working joystick, ultra-minimal popups, top-center missions, and clean edges, are fully functional alongside this new feature.
