The AI engineer's work on TurfLoot started with critical frontend debugging (SSR issues, JSX errors, hoisting) and UI refinements (region selector, navigation redesign). A significant effort involved implementing the Party Lobby system backend and integrating its frontend, which later required removing redundant UI elements. Persistent issues with name changes and friends functionality highlighted deep-seated production deployment problems (Kubernetes/Caddy proxy, dev vs. production builds), leading to the creation of client-side fallbacks and a new bulletproof names API. The focus consistently shifted between resolving local development issues, addressing user-reported production errors, and enhancing core multiplayer features. The trajectory concludes with the AI acknowledging remaining issues in the add friends functionality, specifically shared friend lists, self-addition, lack of notifications, and dynamic updates, setting the stage for the next development cycle.

<product_requirements>
TurfLoot, an Agar.io-style game, aims to be a robust multiplayer online platform. Initial requirements included mobile joysticks, action buttons, a dynamic minimap, stats/leaderboards, and an orientation gate. Core gameplay features like split cells, orb collection, merge timers, and mock data for paid lobbies (-00) were requested. Backend support for paid rooms, a gold cash-out, and mission reward balance sync were also needed.

Recent explicit requests and their current implementation status:
1.  **Mobile customization screen redesign**: Started.
2.  **Modernizing social popup**: Started.
3.  **Navigation bar redesign**: Implemented with new designs for region selector, settings, and login, following the style of a removed Party Lobby button.
4.  **Dynamic Players in Game update**: Backend logic ready, frontend integration partially done.
5.  **Compact region selection dropdown with Oceania & real-time latency**: Implemented in .
6.  **Remove 0.0000 SOL â€¢ 0.00 USDC from wallet box**: Addressed by fixing 0 balance display.
7.  **Username section redesign**: Backend update endpoint implemented, frontend redesign implemented, but persistent server-side saving was problematic and required a new dedicated API route and client-side fallbacks.
8.  **Fix account balance (showing 0) & username update errors (404/500)**: Balance fixed. Username update API was a persistent production issue, leading to client-side persistence with server-sync retries.
9.  **Add Lobby button next to Profile/Settings**: Implemented, then redundant ones were removed. Backend lobby system is operational.
10. **Real-time social features**: Friends panel, online status, and shared practice mode implemented using Socket.IO, though friend list persistence and sharing issues remain.
11. **Users can add each other and join live games**: Partial implementation through Party Lobby and shared practice server, but friends list functionality needs refinement.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Centralized backend API routes.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented ,  (fixed Privy token parsing),  (enhanced error logging, database operations, validation), all 5 Party Lobby endpoints, and friends API endpoints (, ). Fixed routing logic and added error handling.
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   **Summary**: A new, simplified bulletproof API endpoint for name storage and retrieval, designed to bypass persistent production infrastructure issues by providing a dedicated, isolated route for name-related operations.
    -   **Changes**: Created to handle  for name saving and  for name retrieval and user search (). Uses MongoDB.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main landing page, containing core UI logic and client-side interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Added Oceania to region selection. Implemented/removed Party Lobby UI elements. Extensive debugging and refactoring for JSX errors and JavaScript hoisting. Privy authentication re-integrated. Navigation bar redesigned with new button styles (Region, Settings, Login).  fixed to use correct API endpoint ().  enhanced for  persistence and server-side retries, then later simplified to use *only*  with local storage for frontend. Integrated  dynamically.  component issue fixed. Practice mode routing updated to use global shared server. Removed fallbacks for name loading and saving to rely on the new bulletproof API and localStorage.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing critical issues with the add friends functionality. The user reported that their own name appeared on the friends list after logging in on another device and attempting to add themselves, indicating that **friends lists were being shared across accounts**. Additionally, the user pointed out the need for **friend request notifications** and **dynamic updates** of the friends list pop-up page once a friend has been added.

The AI acknowledged these four specific issues:
1.  Friends lists are shared across accounts.
2.  Users can add themselves.
3.  No friend request notifications.
4.  Friends list doesn't update dynamically.

The previous work involved implementing a bulletproof names API () and updating the frontend (, ) to use this API and  for name and friends data persistence, explicitly removing previous production API fallbacks. This was a response to recurring production deployment issues leading to 500 errors on the original  and  endpoints. While the local development environment functions with client-side name persistence and a basic friends panel, the core server-side logic for a true multiplayer friends system (with unique lists, request/accept flow, and real-time updates) is not yet fully implemented or correctly isolated per user.
