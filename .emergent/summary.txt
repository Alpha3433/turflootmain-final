The AI engineer's trajectory centered on migrating the TurfLoot game to a Hathora-first multiplayer architecture. Key early efforts involved resolving a  error in the  component and integrating Helius API for wallet functionality. Significant refactoring was undertaken in  and  to ensure Hathora room creation and WebSocket connections. Despite successfully creating Hathora rooms and navigating to the game page, a persistent issue with WebSocket connections emerged. The root cause identified in the latest messages is that the  URL parameter is incorrectly passed as the string 'true' instead of the actual room ID, leading to invalid WebSocket URLs and connection failures.

<product_requirements>
The TurfLoot application is an Agar.io-style military-themed multiplayer game built with Hathora for game servers and Privy for authentication, targeting both mobile and desktop. The core objective is to transition the MVP into a fully authoritative Hathora-based multiplayer experience.

**Implemented features & fixes:**
*   **Redesigned Server Browser:** Features a functional modal with condensed information, stake filters, region flags, dynamic player counts, CDN-based client-side ping (cached, color-coded, auto-sorting), and Hathora room creation/joining.
*   **Wallet Functionality:** Successfully fixed through Helius API key integration, enabling real SOL balance display.
*   **Hathora Integration:** Refactored for robust room creation, correct region mapping, authenticated WebSocket connection, and removal of local server fallbacks. Includes loading modals and retry logic.
*   **Enhanced Loading Popup:** Displays for 5+ seconds with progressive status updates.

**Current Overhaul Requirements (Authoritative Hathora Rooms):**
*   All game logic must be server-side.
*   **Server Browser-First:** Direct load into online matches; list active, pre-warmed rooms, then create new.
*   **Room Lifecycle:** On-demand creation, 8-minute keep-alive, pre-warm 1 room/region/tier during peak.
*   **Networking:** WebSocket transport (Hathora), 20 Hz tick rate.
*   **Support:** Spectator & Party support. Backend Monitoring via Hathora Console.
*   **Exclusion:** Server-side bot management for auto-fill not required.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the advanced stages of a complete overhaul of the TurfLoot application's multiplayer experience, transitioning it to a 100% Hathora-first and server browser-first model. This involved extensive refactoring of  and  for game initialization and Hathora room creation, alongside updates to  for direct interaction with Hathora rooms.

Significant progress has been made:
1.  The initial  error in  was resolved, and the server browser UI functions correctly.
2.  Wallet functionality was restored by updating the Helius API key in  and verified to successfully validate funds for multiplayer entry.
3.  Hathora rooms are being successfully created, and the application navigates to the  game page with the correct .

However, the immediate blocker is that **WebSocket connections to these newly created Hathora rooms are failing.** The core issue, identified in the latest logs, is that the  URL parameter, intended to carry the actual room ID, is incorrectly being set to the string literal  during navigation. This results in an invalid WebSocket URL format (e.g., ), preventing the client from establishing a connection to the authoritative Hathora server. Consequently, Hathora console metrics for connection count and egress bandwidth remain at zero, despite active rooms.
