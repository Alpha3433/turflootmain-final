The trajectory details the work on TurfLoot, an Agar.io-style game, by an AI engineer. The initial focus was on mobile responsiveness, a major customization system overhaul, in-game economy, and core game mechanics, most notably the Split mechanic. The current AI engineer inherited the task to finalize the Split mechanic by enabling individual split cells to collect orbs. However, this work stalled due to a persistent Next.js build error (Return statement is not allowed here in ), which prevented the game from loading and thus any testing. The engineer spent considerable time debugging bracket mismatches and structural issues without success. The final decision, confirmed by the user, was to invoke the  to resolve this blocking syntax error, marking a transition from feature implementation to critical bug fixing.

TurfLoot, an Agar.io-style real-time multiplayer game, aims for substantial mobile optimization and feature expansion from its MVP. Key user requirements included functional mobile joysticks and action buttons, mission notifications, a dynamic minimap, mobile stat/leaderboard panels, and an orientation gate. The project focused on mobile UI refinements, enhanced player experience (waged balance, mission tracking fixes), a comprehensive customization overhaul (mobile-friendly modal, skin management, removal of Hats), and integration of an in-game economy with persistent coin rewards. Core game mechanics were adjusted, including increased virus count, player speed tuning, and the full implementation of the Agar.io-style Split mechanic (up to 16 cells, 10s cooldown, 15s merge lock). A modern Game Over popup was also designed. The immediate task involves ensuring individual split cells can collect orbs and increase their mass.

<code_architecture>

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Centralized backend API routes handling user data, game economy, and various game-related operations.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented  for giving in-game currency and  for retrieving player coin balances. These are crucial for the in-game economy.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This is the core game component, responsible for all real-time game logic, canvas rendering, and UI interactions across desktop and mobile.
    -   **Changes**: Significant modifications include increasing virus count and adjusting player speed. Major work involved implementing the Split mechanic with state management (), input handling for splitting (, ), visual rendering for multiple cells, movement logic, cooldowns, and merge conditions. Player mass synchronization was ensured. The UI received a redesigned game over popup. The current blocking issue, a Next.js syntax error, resides here, preventing the game from loading and testing the intended orb collection by split cells.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main landing page of the application, serving as the entry point and integrating key features like customization and user balance display.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated the  component, updated  state to manage current player appearance, and added  state to display the player's coin count. The  was removed, streamlining the game entry flow.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This component handles the player customization interface, allowing users to select and apply skins.
    -   **Changes**: Streamlined the customization options by removing Hats, Upgrade Rarity, Trails, and Faces, focusing solely on Skins. It manages , , and , with implemented color previews, layout fixes, and item persistence. Crucially, it separates shop items from collected items.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: A dedicated client-side page created for testing customization features in isolation, aiding development and debugging efforts.
    -   **Changes**: This file was newly created for developmental purposes and acts as a sandbox for the customization modal.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Real Blockchain Integration**: Implement full SOL deposits/withdrawals and smart contract interaction for game entry fees.
-   **Production Infrastructure**: Resolve persistent 502 Bad Gateway errors on external URLs at the infrastructure level.
-   Test the split cell orb collection functionality by capturing an in-game screenshot (currently blocked by a syntax error).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was critically engaged in debugging a persistent Next.js syntax error within . The overarching goal was to verify the Split Cell Orb Collection feature, where individual split cells should collect orbs and increase their mass. However, this testing was entirely blocked because the application failed to build or run, consistently throwing a 500 Internal Server Error with messages like Return statement is not allowed here (e.g., at lines 3735, 3738) and Expression expected (e.g., at line 4825). These errors point to fundamental structural problems within the React component or JavaScript function closures, particularly related to  and  functions. The engineer has attempted multiple fixes, focusing on  tags and brace matching, but the error persists. The  was previously invoked, identifying a premature closure, but subsequent manual attempts to fix it were unsuccessful. The work is currently stalled awaiting a resolution to this critical syntax issue.
