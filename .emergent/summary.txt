The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the TurfLoot application from MVP to a more feature-rich state, addressing numerous UI/UX, game mechanics, and authentication concerns. Key accomplishments include overhauling the character customization system, integrating a robust random username system, and refining in-game visuals like animated currency pickups and dynamic player statistics (balance, total mass). Critical fixes involved resolving mission tracking inaccuracies and ensuring authentication prompts for unauthenticated users. The cash-out flow was a point of iteration, initially made instant then reverted to a detailed popup based on user feedback. The current focus is on a major pivot to integrate real Solana blockchain transactions and transition from bot-based gameplay to true real-time multiplayer, for which mainnet credentials have just been configured.

TurfLoot is an Agario-style game where players compete to gain land and earn SOL on the Solana blockchain. The objective is to deliver an engaging multiplayer experience with secure authentication and a fully functional, real-money economy. Implemented features include Privy.io authentication, a dark-themed UI, live pot ticker, user profiles, game stats, and responsive design. Core game mechanics involve player movement, orb-based growth, virus collision, and a hold-'E' cash-out system. UI enhancements include geometric virus visuals, animated currency pickups, and real-time cash-out notifications. User privacy is maintained via a random, unique username system. A comprehensive character customization system allows equipping skins, hats, and faces, visible in-game. Recent additions include dynamic player balance display over heads, a 'Total Mass' metric, and fixed Eliminate 3 and Survive 60 seconds missions. The cash-out flow now presents a detailed success popup. The current development goal is to enable actual SOL deposits and withdrawals, integrate smart contracts, and transition to real-time multiplayer with server-side validation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was preparing for the critical implementation of real money flow via Solana blockchain integration and true real-time multiplayer. The user had just requested these specific features: real SOL deposits for cash games, real SOL withdrawals on cash-out (beyond just a popup), smart contract integration for game entry fees, frontend connection to the Socket.IO server (replacing mock bots), real-time player position/action synchronization, and server-side anti-cheat validation for territory updates.

To kick off this phase, the AI engineer first initiated a call to the  for Solana blockchain integration. Subsequently, to understand the existing setup, the engineer reviewed , which defines the Socket.IO server's structure, and , the main game client. The most recent and crucial action taken was to obtain and then **successfully update the  file with the user-provided production mainnet credentials**: Privy App ID, Privy App Secret, Privy authentication private key, Helius RPC URL, and Helius Standard Websocket URL. This final step has configured the application's environment for real Solana transactions, setting the immediate stage for implementing the actual deposit and withdrawal functionalities.
