The previous AI engineer meticulously advanced the TurfLoot application from an MVP to a near production-ready, blockchain-integrated multiplayer game. The work followed an iterative and problem-solving trajectory, addressing both user-requested features and critical technical debt. Key achievements include migrating to a real-time Socket.IO multiplayer system, implementing robust Privy.io authentication, and significantly enhancing the UI/UX with features like a server browser, dynamic in-game stats, and a redesigned tactical minimap. Extensive effort was dedicated to visually transforming the landing page with dynamic, animated game assets. Furthermore, the engineer systematically debugged and resolved complex deployment failures, primarily related to Yarn package manager inconsistencies, peer dependency conflicts, and Next.js build configurations for Kaniko, ensuring the application is now deployment-ready. While the blockchain wallet balance update function is implemented in code, its full functionality remains hampered by persistent external server infrastructure (502 Bad Gateway) issues, a problem outside the code's immediate scope. The engineer consistently confirmed fixes with screenshots and detailed console logs.

<product_requirements>
TurfLoot is an Agario-style real-time multiplayer game integrated with Solana (SOL) blockchain. Its core objective is to offer an engaging multiplayer experience with secure authentication via Privy.io, a dark UI, and responsive design. Key gameplay involves player movement, orb collection, virus collision, and a cash-out system. The application transitioned from bot-based to real-time multiplayer, necessitating server-side anti-cheat and smart contract interaction for game entry fees and prize distribution. UI/UX enhancements included unique usernames, detailed character customization (materials, textures, rarity glows), dynamic player stats (Coins Collected, Time Alive), fixed mission tracking, a functional server browser with indicators, and a redesigned, high-contrast in-game minimap. The application aims for robust authentication and deployment readiness, with significant work done on resolving technical debt related to deployment and UI functionality. However, real blockchain wallet balance display remains problematic due to external server infrastructure (502 Bad Gateway) issues.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in two primary concurrent efforts: resolving persistent Kaniko deployment failures and fixing unresponsive UI elements on the landing page.

For deployment failures, the focus was on eliminating warnings that were potentially treated as errors by the build pipeline. This involved:
1.  **Peer Dependency Resolution**: Aligning  to  (from ) across , , and  in  to satisfy Solana wallet adapter requirements. Existing  for  were maintained while removing specific  force installs to prevent dual versions.
2.  **Yarn Engine/Workspace Warnings**: Ensuring  had , creating a  file with , and configuring  with  and . The  was updated to copy  and use tolerant yarn install v1.22.22

3.  **Previous Compile Fixes**: The AI had previously fixed a missing  export in  and a Webpack symbol collision ( import/export) in , ensuring this page uses a client-only component and dynamic imports correctly. It also removed  usage in  in favor of UUIDs.

For unresponsive UI buttons, the AI addressed the landing page buttons not triggering actions. This involved:
1.  **Z-index and Pointer Events**: Adjusting CSS  properties in  (e.g.,  for main content,  for background) and ensuring the background element had  to prevent it from blocking clicks on foreground elements.
2.  **Socket.IO Configuration**: Updating the Socket.IO client configuration in  to use the correct ingress path () and , ensuring real-time lobby features work correctly in the deployed environment.

The current state is that all identified code-level issues preventing successful Kaniko builds (compile errors, key warnings) have been addressed, and the landing page buttons are now functional. The AI is awaiting the user to trigger the Kaniko deployment to confirm the fixes.

<optional_next_step>
The immediate next step is to re-run the Kaniko/emergent deployment using the updated codebase to verify the build process succeeds.
