This trajectory details the development of TurfLoot, an Agar.io-style game. The previous AI engineer primarily focused on enhancing the mobile UI/UX and expanding game features. Initial critical build errors were resolved, followed by comprehensive mobile customization modal optimization (including landscape support), social modal redesign, and navigation bar consistency. Key backend logic for paid rooms and dynamic player counts was implemented. Later tasks involved fixing a mobile white screen (JS errors) and refining landing page elements like player count display, region selection dropdown, and wallet text. The work culminated in extensive UI/UX improvements across the app, ensuring responsiveness and a modern aesthetic. The trajectory ends with the engineer in the process of implementing real-time server latency for the region selection dropdown.

TurfLoot is an Agar.io-style real-time multiplayer game needing significant mobile optimization and feature expansion. Initial goals included mobile joysticks, action buttons, dynamic minimap, stat/leaderboard panels, and an orientation gate. Key accomplishments included enabling split cells to collect orbs, cleaning mobile in-game UI, adjusting split cell merge timing to 8 seconds, and making mock data popups realistic for paid lobbies (, , 0, 0, 00). The cash-out button was styled gold with a progress ring, and comprehensive backend logic for paid rooms was implemented and integrated into the UI. Mission reward balance updates sync across the navigation bar and customization modal. Recent explicit requests included redesigning the mobile customization screen for better readability and layout, making it work in landscape mode, modernizing the social popup for both mobile (portrait/landscape) and desktop, redesigning the navigation bar for consistency, dynamically updating the Players in Game count based on paid room players, replacing the server browser modal with a compact region selection dropdown, removing 0.0000 SOL • 0.00 USDC text from the wallet box, redesigning the username section and associated buttons, and finally, adding Oceania to the region dropdown with real-time latency.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the region selection dropdown on the landing page. The user explicitly requested to:
1.  Add Oceania to the list of available regions in the dropdown.
2.  Implement actual real-life latency (ping) measurement for all regions (US-East-1, US-West-1, EU-Central-1, and the newly added Oceania) instead of displaying hardcoded values.

The AI engineer has begun implementing these changes in . So far, the steps taken include:
-   Adding Oceania to the regions array.
-   Initiating the implementation of real ping measurement for all regions.
-   Updating the region selection handler to integrate these real-time ping values.

The current state is that the engineer is in the process of updating the dropdown display to show these real-time ping values and incorporating loading indicators for when the latency is being measured. This work is ongoing, with the last action being an edit to  to modify the dropdown display logic.
