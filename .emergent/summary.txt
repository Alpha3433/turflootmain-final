The AI engineer's trajectory details a focused, iterative development process on the TurfLoot application, primarily targeting mobile user experience enhancements and critical bug fixes. The work began by redesigning the mobile landing page from a 2x2 grid to a vertical stack, reordering key panels (Wallet, Customize, Leaderboard, Party). A significant in-game improvement was the recreation of a virtual joystick for mobile, coupled with optimized action buttons, addressing a gap in mobile game controls.

Subsequent efforts refined the UI further, including removing emojis, standardizing the mobile Customize panel's character design to match desktop, and adding an engaging scroll-based eye-tracking effect. Bug fixes involved implementing the missing  function and resolving a mobile background reset during username input via . Mobile UI consistency was ensured by re-adding the Create Party button and aligning party button texts with desktop. An authentication popup on the mobile Withdraw button was also suppressed. The trajectory concludes with the implementation of a landscape orientation enforcement for mobile game entry, currently in the phase of adding the modal UI.

<product_requirements>
The TurfLoot application is an Agar.io-style multiplayer game with a military theme, leveraging Hathora for game servers and Privy for wallet and authentication. The core objective is to enhance the existing MVP through UI/UX improvements, bug fixes, and robust social features, with a strong focus on mobile experience.

**Currently Implemented Features:**
*   **UI/UX**: Mobile layout redesigned to a vertical stack for WALLET, CUSTOMIZE, LEADERBOARD, and PARTY sections. Mobile character customization preview updated to a blue circular avatar with black eyes (no green ring), featuring a scroll-based eye-tracking effect. In-game mobile buttons (CASH OUT, SPLIT) optimized for touch.
*   **Social System**: Persistent friends/party system with mobile  panel now including  and  buttons, aligning text with desktop.
*   **Mobile Parity**: Full mobile support including wallet, leaderboard, and game controls, with a recreated virtual joystick for in-game movement.
*   **Game Mechanics**: Authentic Agar.io splitting, directional ejection, merging, real-time Time Alive, cash-out visualization.
*   **Bug Fixes**: Solana-only deposit via Privy fixed (using  v2.24.0, Helius RPC, 10% fee). Privy login and game button authentication issues resolved.  modal delay fixed (asynchronous friends list loading). Missing  function implemented. Mobile background reset on username input fixed using . Mobile WITHDRAW button authentication popup removed.
*   **User Interaction**: Player name on the mobile navigation bar now updates dynamically based on user input.

**Current Task:** Implementing a non-intrusive solution to force mobile players into landscape mode when entering any in-game experience, preventing access in portrait mode.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enforcing a landscape orientation requirement for mobile players before they can enter any in-game experience. The user explicitly requested that mobile users should be prevented from accessing the game if their device is in portrait mode, requiring them to rotate it to landscape. The AI engineer has already implemented the core logic: an  check,  function to verify the device's current orientation, and the  state to control the visibility of an informational modal. The  button on the main page (), which serves as a game entry point, has been updated to use this  function. The current phase of work is focused on adding the actual UI component for this  to the  file.
