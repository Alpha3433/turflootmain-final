This trajectory chronicles the intensive development of TurfLoot, an Agar.io-style game, by a previous AI engineer. The initial focus was on mobile UI/UX enhancements and feature expansion, including fixing critical build errors, optimizing customization and social modals, and refining the navigation bar. Key backend logic for paid rooms and dynamic player counts was implemented. Significant effort was then directed at resolving persistent server-side rendering (SSR) issues, primarily caused by the Privy authentication provider, necessitating dynamic imports and Webpack externalization. Concurrently, the engineer addressed a non-functional real-time ping for region selection, a zero balance display due to missing API endpoints and incorrect Privy token handling, and username update failures caused by a missing backend endpoint. The work concluded with the successful implementation and visibility of a Party Lobby button across desktop and mobile, alongside its backend infrastructure, and confirmation of server-sided username persistence, despite ongoing production infrastructure concerns.

<product_requirements>
TurfLoot, an Agar.io-style game, requires robust mobile optimization and feature expansion. Initial requirements included mobile joysticks, action buttons, dynamic minimap, stats/leaderboard panels, and an orientation gate. Core functionality involved enabling split cells to collect orbs, cleaning mobile in-game UI, adjusting split cell merge timing to 8 seconds, and realistic mock data popups for paid lobbies (-00). A gold cash-out button with progress ring, comprehensive backend for paid rooms, and mission reward balance sync were also required. Recent explicit requests involved:
1.  Redesigning the mobile customization screen for readability and landscape support.
2.  Modernizing the social popup for mobile/desktop.
3.  Redesigning the navigation bar for consistency.
4.  Dynamically updating Players in Game (paid rooms only).
5.  Replacing the server browser with a compact region selection dropdown including Oceania with real-time latency.
6.  Removing 0.0000 SOL â€¢ 0.00 USDC from the wallet box.
7.  Redesigning the username section.
8.  Fixing account balance (showing 0) and username update errors (404/500).
9.  Adding a Lobby button next to Profile/Settings in the nav bar, opening a dropdown for inviting friends and joining paid rooms.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Centralized backend API routes for the entire application.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented  endpoint. Fixed balance calculation in  to correctly parse Privy tokens and create new users with a default 5.00 balance. Added  endpoint to manage and persist user custom names. Implemented various lobby management endpoints (, , , , ). Debugged and corrected the routing logic for new API endpoints.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main landing page, containing core UI logic and client-side interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Added Oceania to the region selection dropdown and implemented real-time ping measurement for all regions. Introduced client-side guards for DOM-related operations ( errors). Added  state and rendered the Lobby button in the navigation bar, along with the Party Lobby dropdown UI. Integrated JavaScript functions for lobby creation, joining, and inviting friends. Fixed positioning and visibility issues of the Lobby button for both authenticated/unauthenticated users and desktop/mobile views.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The root layout component for the application.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to dynamically import  with  to resolve  errors caused by Privy's Lit Elements during server-side rendering.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Provides Privy authentication context to the application.
    -   **Changes**: Wrapped the component in a client-side only provider () to ensure Privy-related code executes exclusively on the client, resolving SSR conflicts.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Handles UI adjustments based on device orientation.
    -   **Changes**: Added client-side guards () to prevent  and  object access during server-side rendering, resolving  errors.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Likely responsible for in-game lobby functionality (though not directly modified in this trajectory, it was identified as a potential source of SSR issues).
    -   **Changes**: Added client-side guards () around , , , etc. to resolve  errors.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Next.js project configuration.
    -   **Changes**: Added Webpack configuration to externalize  and  from server bundles, which was crucial for resolving persistent  SSR errors related to Privy.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Real Blockchain Integration**: Implement full SOL deposits/withdrawals and smart contract interaction for game entry fees (backend paid room logic is ready).
-   **Production Infrastructure Stability**: Resolve persistent 500 Internal Server Error (and previously 502 Bad Gateway) on production for username updates and other API calls, which is an infrastructure/Kubernetes routing issue, not a code issue.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully ensured the Lobby button is visible and functional on both desktop and mobile versions of the TurfLoot application. This involved extensive debugging and refactoring of the frontend navigation in  to correctly position the button. The button is styled appropriately (gray with a lock icon for non-authenticated users, orange for authenticated users) and acts as a gateway to the Party Lobby system. The backend endpoints for lobby creation, joining, and inviting friends were also fully implemented and tested in , although some routing issues were encountered and resolved during the process. The core UI element and its backend support are now complete and visible in the application's navigation bar.
