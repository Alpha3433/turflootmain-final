The AI engineer's trajectory involved a highly iterative process of UI refinement and feature integration for a Next.js application, primarily focusing on the  landing page. Initially, the core task revolved around fine-tuning the Military/Tactical theme by adjusting panel dimensions and positions, with multiple user corrections for precise visual alignment. Subsequent efforts included dynamic text updates, mock data removal for leaderboards, and a complete redesign of the customization panel. A significant portion involved integrating Privy authentication. Critical challenges arose with modal visibility on desktop, leading to extensive debugging. The root cause was identified as a React rendering limitation with fixed-position elements on desktop, leading to a shift towards direct DOM manipulation for modals. This strategy proved successful for both the Leaderboard and Create Party popups, showcasing adaptability in overcoming framework-specific hurdles. The latest task involves adding a JOIN PARTY button.

TurfLoot is an Agar.io-style global multiplayer game featuring Hathora for servers, a 2-player Party Lobby, dynamic leaderboards, and Privy wallet integration. Initial development addressed a broken landing page UI, leading to several redesigns (e.g., modern minimalist, gaming interface, space/cosmic, modern glass/neumorphism, retro gaming/synthwave), culminating in the current military/tactical theme. All redesigns strictly preserved existing functionality, buttons, and icons. Recent product requests focused on refining the Military/Tactical theme: optimizing panel layout (positioning and sizing), ensuring consistent dimensions, dynamic updates for game elements (e.g., active friends, leaderboard cashouts), text revisions (e.g., SERVER BROWSER to LEADERBOARD, SWEEP to REFRESH), removing mock data, and redesigning the customization display to a circular in-game style. Core functionalities like Privy authentication, opening the Server Browser, Leaderboard, and Create Party modals were critical.

- ****: This is the central landing page and has undergone extensive modifications for UI, functionality, and integration.
    - **Importance**: Displays the main game interface, panels, and handles user interactions for stake selection, username input, and various button actions.
    - **Changes**: Iteratively updated for design themes (Military/Tactical), incorporating inline styles, / for animations and dynamic content (e.g., username, active friends, mock leaderboard), and handling panel positioning/sizing. Recent significant changes include:
        - Adjusting panel widths (, , , ) to  for symmetry.
        - Fine-tuning  height to match  using internal spacing and button padding adjustments.
        - Renaming SERVER BROWSER panel title to LEADERBOARD and BROWSE SERVERS button to VIEW LEADERBOARD.
        - Changing [‚Üª] SWEEP to [‚Üª] REFRESH (as a button) in the PARTY panel and enabling dynamic friend count simulation.
        - Removing mock leaderboard data and initially implementing dynamic mock cashout data, later removed for a clean LOADING state.
        - Redesigning the  panel's visual element from a red block to a circular in-game design, and changing üéØ UPGRADE SKIN to VIEW STORE.
        - Adding a üîê LOGIN button to the navigation bar, integrating Privy authentication state.
        - Implementing dynamic username display in the navigation (PLAYER: [USERNAME]) that updates from the center input and overrides Privy-provided names via a tick button.
        - Integrating the main SERVER BROWSER button (next to HOW TO PLAY) to open the .
        - Integrating the VIEW LEADERBOARD button to open a dynamic desktop-only leaderboard popup, implemented using direct DOM manipulation.
        - Integrating the CREATE PARTY button to open a dynamic desktop-only party creation popup, also via direct DOM manipulation.
- ****: Defines global styles and imports Tailwind CSS.
    - **Importance**: Provides base styling for the application.
    - **Changes**: Minimal, mainly for background consistency to prevent white outlines.
- ****: Manages project dependencies.
    - **Importance**: Records all required libraries and their versions.
    - **Changes**:  was removed.  is listed as a dependency.
- ****: Component for displaying available game servers.
    - **Importance**: Provides the core functionality for users to browse and join game lobbies.
    - **Changes**: Was imported into  and connected via  state. Its  was increased for visibility on desktop.
- ****: (New File) Dedicated component for desktop leaderboard display.
    - **Importance**: Replaced  to provide a desktop-optimized leaderboard view.
    - **Changes**: Created and initially struggled with visibility on desktop. Ultimately, its functionality was superseded by a direct DOM manipulation approach within  for desktop display, and the file was removed implicitly by the final code.
- ****: Component that was initially considered for the leaderboard.
    - **Importance**: Contains existing leaderboard, profile, and social features, primarily designed for mobile.
    - **Changes**: Identified as suitable for initial leaderboard integration but later bypassed for desktop-specific modal.
- ****: Provides the Privy authentication context.
    - **Importance**: Wraps the application to make Privy authentication available globally.
    - **Changes**: Checked for existence and used as-is, confirming  is used.
- ****: Main layout file for the Next.js application.
    - **Importance**: Defines the root layout and global providers.
    - **Changes**: Updated to use  instead of  for actual Privy integration.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully created and integrated a new dynamic CREATE PARTY popup. This popup appears when a user clicks the CREATE PARTY button within the PARTY panel on the landing page. It utilizes the direct DOM manipulation approach, similar to the VIEW LEADERBOARD popup, to ensure proper visibility and functionality specifically on desktop view, bypassing previous React rendering issues. The popup includes form elements for party name, privacy settings (public/private), and maximum players. The AI demonstrated its functionality through screenshots, showing the popup opening, user interaction with form fields, and successful closure.

The very last instruction received from the user, and the task the AI engineer is currently preparing to address, is to add a button above the CREATE PARTY button called JOIN PARTY that allows users to join open parties and join friends party when selected through the new popup.
