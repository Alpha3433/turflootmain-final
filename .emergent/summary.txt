The AI engineer's work on TurfLoot involved a multi-faceted approach, balancing frontend UI/UX enhancements with critical backend bug fixes. Initially, efforts focused on refining the Friends system, tackling issues like shared lists and self-addition, which led to significant refactoring, including the temporary use and eventual removal of  for a purely server-side design. Concurrently, extensive mobile layout optimizations were made, addressing excess grey space, element overlaps, character eye spacing, and introducing horizontal navigation cycling. A persistent challenge throughout the trajectory was resolving API connectivity problems, specifically  and  errors, which necessitated repeated adjustments to environment variables and API call strategies (toggling between relative and absolute URLs). The work concluded with these API errors still presenting, with the AI identifying the preview deployment itself as the likely source of the  issues, indicating an external infrastructure problem.

TurfLoot, an Agar.io-style game, is designed as a multiplayer online platform. Initial features included mobile joysticks, action buttons, a dynamic minimap, stats/leaderboards, and an orientation gate. Core gameplay such as cell splitting, orb collection, merge timers, and mock data for paid lobbies (-00) were requested, alongside backend support for paid rooms, gold cash-out, and mission reward balance sync.

The previous AI engineer addressed several explicit requests:
1.  **Mobile customization screen redesign**: Ongoing.
2.  **Modernizing social popup**: Ongoing.
3.  **Navigation bar redesign**: Implemented with region selector, settings, and login, plus new mobile horizontal cycling.
4.  **Dynamic Players in Game update**: Backend ready, frontend partial.
5.  **Compact region selection with Oceania & latency**: Implemented.
6.  **Fix 0 balance display**: Addressed.
7.  **Username section redesign**: Backend and frontend implemented, but server-side saving was problematic and now relies on a dedicated API and no client-side fallbacks.
8.  **Fix account balance & username errors**: Balance fixed. Username API was a persistent issue, leading to a bulletproof names API.
9.  **Add Lobby button**: Implemented, then streamlined. Backend operational.
10. **Real-time social features**: Friends panel, online status, shared practice mode implemented via Socket.IO.
11. **Users can add and join games**: Partially implemented via Party Lobby and shared practice server, but friends list needs refinement.
12. **Fix mobile vertical view (remove grey space)**: Implemented, including background fill and layout optimization.
13. **Fix mobile spacing (customize/leaderboard)**: Implemented, ensuring consistent spacing.
14. **Fix mobile preview eye spacing**: Implemented.
15. **Friends functionality to be purely server-side/online-only**: Implemented, with all  usage removed.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing persistent  errors affecting the friends functionality and other API calls in the development environment. Despite previous attempts to configure  correctly in  (toggling between  and the preview URL) and implementing debug logs to trace URL resolution, the console logs consistently showed frontend requests correctly forming relative API URLs () but still receiving  responses from .

This indicates that the frontend is correctly constructing its requests and the environment variable is being picked up, but the issue lies in the accessibility or configuration of the **preview deployment's backend itself**. The previous round of fixes involved eliminating  for a pure server-side architecture (per user request), fixing  error by destructuring  from , and adding a  state variable in . However, these fixes are being overshadowed by the persistent backend connectivity issue with the preview environment. The system's current state is that the friends features are implemented to be server-only, but they cannot function due to the  from the target server.
