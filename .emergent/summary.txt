The previous AI engineer focused on critical bug fixes and implementing multiplayer features for the TurfLoot application. Key initial efforts involved overhauling the server browser for real-time ping and region mapping, resolving API integration and MongoDB connectivity issues, and refactoring Hathora client integration for correct room creation. Major problems tackled included a persistent Hathora SDK connection issue, a broken wallet functionality due to a disabled API route, and region mapping discrepancies leading to incorrect server creation. The engineer then successfully implemented a WebSocket-based multiplayer connection, dynamic server collapsing in the UI, and continuous debugging of Hathora region parameter formats and WebSocket connectivity, with the last identified issues being a 422 error from the Hathora API for region-specific room creation and persistent WebSocket connection failures.

The TurfLoot application is an Agar.io-style multiplayer game with a military theme, leveraging Hathora for game servers and Privy for authentication. The primary objective is to enhance MVP functionality through UI/UX improvements, bug fixes, and social features, supporting both mobile and desktop.

**Key features and fixes implemented so far:**
*   **Redesigned Server Browser**: A fully functional modal with condensed information, stake filters, region flags, dynamic player counts, real client-side ping measurement (with caching, color-coding, and auto-sorting), and actual Hathora room creation/joining in selected regions. Empty servers are now collapsed into Create New Room entries.
*   **Dynamic Player Counts**: Real Privy user sessions in Hathora rooms are tracked.
*   **Desktop Loading Popup**: Implemented for the LOCAL PRACTICE button.
*   **Wallet Functionality**: Fixed with Helius API key integration, improved wallet detection, and display of real SOL balances post-login. Dedicated wallet balance and transactions API routes were created.
*   **Anti-cheat System**: Debugged, made lenient, and temporarily disabled for testing.
*   **In-game Fixes**: Fixed Canvas Gradient  error when interacting with viruses.
*   **Database Connectivity**: Resolved MongoDB connection issues by updating .
*   **Hathora Integration**: Refactored for robust room creation, simplified  calls, and addressed HathoraClientModule is not a constructor errors. Region mapping was iteratively fixed to use correct Hathora region formats/city names.
*   **Multiplayer Core**: WebSocket connection logic integrated into the game client for real-time multiplayer, including UI indicators for connection status and player count.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Main landing page, UI, authentication.
    -   **Changes**: Updated  for Hathora room creation. Fixed  variable re-declaration conflict. Corrected  extraction to prevent  issue. Updated  call for servers API.
-   ****: Core in-game experience, canvas.
    -   **Changes**: Relaxed/disabled anti-cheat. Added  checks. Integrated  for player session tracking. **Crucially, implemented Hathora WebSocket client connection logic for multiplayer games, including state management and UI indicators.** Attempted inline CSS, then removed.
-   ****: Catch-all API route.
    -   **Changes**: Renamed to  to resolve build errors, effectively disabling it. Wallet logic was formerly here.
-   ****: Dedicated API for server list.
    -   **Changes**: Generates 35 cash game servers across regions, uses  for player counts, AWS EC2 for pings. No simulated data.
-   ****: API for real-time player sessions.
    -   **Changes**: Handles  requests for recording, updating, removing active player sessions.
-   ** (New)**: Dedicated API for fetching wallet balance.
    -   **Changes**: Created to restore wallet functionality, integrates with Helius API.
-   ** (New)**: Dedicated API for fetching wallet transactions.
    -   **Changes**: Created to restore wallet functionality, integrates with Helius API.
-   ****: Hathora client integration.
    -   **Changes**: Removed problematic  calls. Updated  and  to correctly pass region parameters within an options object.  was iteratively refined (initially to city names, then AWS region codes, then back to city names like sydney, and finally to general region names like asia with an attempt to use  for websocket connection). Corrected singleton export.
-   ****: Redesigned server browser UI.
    -   **Changes**: Renamed title, removed practice server filters. Implemented client-side ping, auto-sorting. **Redesigned to collapse empty servers into + Create New Room entries.** Removed  state.
-   ****: Environment variables.
    -   **Changes**: Updated , . Verified Hathora environment variables exist.
-   ****: Global CSS styles.
    -   **Changes**: Added  for UI animation.
-   ** (New)**: Documented the analysis and recommendations for Hathora server management strategy (on-demand vs. hybrid).

<pending_tasks>
-   Mobile Customization Screen Redesign (remaining design aspects).
-   Modernizing Social Popup.
-   Production Infrastructure Stability: Address persistent 502/404/ERR_ABORTED errors for  calls.
-   Implement core  button functionality in Wallet Snapshot (beyond UI).
-   Re-integrate and ensure functionality of the complex player report modal.
-   Dynamically change the Available Balance text color in the Cash Out modal to green for positive balances and red for zero balances.
-   Make the Enter Solana wallet address placeholder text smaller.
-   Hathora API still rejects specified regions (e.g., asia) for room creation, causing a 422 error and fallback to Washington D.C.
-   WebSocket connection to Hathora rooms fails (Error 1006) even after retrieving correct connection details.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing two critical remaining issues in the full multiplayer implementation for TurfLoot.

First, despite numerous attempts to fix the region mapping for Hathora room creation, clicking an Oceania server () still resulted in the Hathora API rejecting the specified region (last attempted with , previously  and ) with a  error. This forces the Hathora client to fall back to creating a room in its default region, Washington D.C., rather than the intended Sydney region. The internal region matching logic for displaying servers is now confirmed to be working, correctly identifying Sydney servers for an Oceania request, but the issue lies in what parameter format the Hathora API actually accepts for region-specific room creation.

Second, the newly implemented WebSocket connection for multiplayer in  is failing. While the  method is successfully retrieving the correct  and  (e.g., ), the  constructor is still reporting a  error. This indicates a problem with establishing the WebSocket connection itself, possibly due to an incorrect WebSocket path within the URL or an underlying network/configuration issue preventing the connection to Hathora's edge servers.

The AI engineer's last action was to prepare to research and try different Hathora region codes and investigate potential WebSocket path issues to resolve these two persistent problems.
