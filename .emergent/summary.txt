The AI engineer's trajectory reveals a methodical, iterative approach to refining the TurfLoot Arena mode based on continuous user feedback. The initial phase focused on implementing core -like features: mobile optimization for the server browser, arena camera lock to the player, resolving a spacebar split disconnect bug, and enforcing a circular boundary. Subsequent work, detailed in the trajectory, primarily addressed user requests to precisely match the  practice mode's playable area, minimap, boundaries, and gameplay mechanics. This involved extensive modifications to client-side rendering () and server-side logic (, ) for , ,  calculations, and boundary enforcement. Challenges included persistent issues with player spawning outside the playable area, incorrect minimap rendering, client-server position mismatches (leading to a switch to server-authoritative movement), and a bug in virus collision mass adjustment. The engineer consistently debugged, adjusted configurations, and synchronized changes between client and server. The current issue being addressed is players spawning outside the designated playable area.

<product_requirements>
The TurfLoot application is an Agar.io-style multiplayer game (Next.js, Colyseus, Privy) aiming for a stable, engaging experience mirroring local  game mechanics and UI. Key objectives include robust client-server communication and safe spawning.

Recent explicit requests focused on:
*   **Arena Map & Boundaries**: Extending/adjusting playable area (initially 1800px, then 2000px radius), expanding red zones, matching local  dimensions, precise boundary enforcement (with/without a red divider), removing/re-adding boundaries, relocating the playable area (top-left) within an 8000x8000 world, and ensuring consistent client/server boundary logic.
*   **Minimap**: Synchronizing minimap dimensions with the playable area, extending red zone visualization, removing gradients, displaying only the black playable area, adding a red divider, and setting its background to #000000.
*   **Gameplay Mechanics**: Ensuring coins/viruses spawn only in the playable area, fixing split functionality to mirror local , correcting a bug where players hitting spikes increased mass to 50 (should reduce to 25), and unifying client-server position handling for accurate synchronization.
*   **Player Attributes**: Consistently setting player default starting mass to 25 across join, respawn, and virus damage.

-   ****
    *   **Importance**: Client-side game logic, UI rendering, player input, and Colyseus connection for arena mode.
    *   **Changes**: Updated  and . Initialized  to 8000x8000. Adjusted player initial  to (2000,2000) for top-left area. Refined minimap drawing, offsets, and styling (black background, no gradients, red divider, correct top-left positioning). Removed client-side boundary drawing. Refactored client movement to be server-authoritative. Added extensive debug logging.
-   ****
    *   **Importance**: Local single-player practice mode, served as a reference for desired  behavior; no direct modifications.
-   ****
    *   **Importance**: Server-side Colyseus game room logic, managing authoritative game state and rules.
    *   **Changes**: Updated . Increased  (4000 -> 6000 -> 8000). Adjusted  and  for spawn/movement (from  to  for top-left placement). Modified  and  to use new center/radius. Implemented and refined circular boundary enforcement (players and split pieces), ensuring checks happen *before* movement and player edge respects the perimeter. Ensured default player mass is 25 and corrected virus collision logic to reduce mass to a minimum of 25. Added aggressive debug logging.
-   ****
    *   **Importance**: Compiled JavaScript of , executed by the Colyseus server.
    *   **Changes**: Manually updated to synchronize with all  modifications, addressing TypeScript compilation and ensuring server-side game logic is up-to-date.

<pending_tasks>
- Fix server-side player spawn position generation to ensure players spawn within the playable area (1800px radius from center 2000, 2000).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was troubleshooting a critical bug where players were spawning outside the designated playable area, within the red zone. A client-side debug log confirmed a spawn position of , a distance of  pixels from the , which is outside the . This indicates a persistent issue with the server-side spawn logic. The engineer has identified that the server-side spawn logic is broken and is preparing to check and fix the spawn position generation, likely within 's  function or the  method that calls it. This fix is crucial for ensuring players start within the intended game boundaries, preventing an immediate out-of-bounds experience upon joining the arena.

<optional_next_step>
Fix the server-side  function in  to correctly calculate player spawn coordinates within the defined 1800px playable radius centered at (2000, 2000).
