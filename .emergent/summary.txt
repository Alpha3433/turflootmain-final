The previous AI engineer's work on TurfLoot involved extensive feature development and bug fixes. Key accomplishments include the successful implementation and verification of the Friends Invitation feature within the CREATE PARTY modal, despite initial misinterpretations. Multiple Invite Friends sections were identified and removed from the landing page to streamline UI. A robust Privy authentication system was integrated, guarding all core landing page buttons except LOCAL PRACTICE. The in-game experience was enhanced with a 4-second spawn protection, a dynamic zone system scaling with player count in cash rooms, and a comprehensive anti-cheat system featuring a 3-strike permanent ban and dedicated modal. The Cash Out Successful modal was redesigned with conditional rendering, and a critical bug preventing player removal after cash-out was fixed. The mission system was refined to a top-center, cycling display, with an intrusive completion popup removed. A persistent invalid address error with Privy's  was ultimately resolved by providing manual deposit instructions. Finally, local practice bots were constrained to the playable area. The current task involves replacing existing navigation bar squares with new icons, but the AI is facing difficulty locating the original elements in the codebase.

<product_requirements>
The TurfLoot application is a military-themed Agar.io-style multiplayer game with Hathora for servers and Privy for wallet integration. The goal is to evolve the MVP by fixing UI and adding features. Initial requirements covered fixing the Hold E to Cash Out bar, enhancing player visuals (eyes, no mass, grid lines), mobile UI fixes, balancing game mechanics (coin density, speed, dynamic leaderboard), adding a missions system, and upgrading the skin store with authentic previews and dynamic currency, ensuring equipped skins update the landing page preview. Recent work further involved: removing redundant Invite Friends sections from the landing page, implementing Privy authentication for all main buttons except LOCAL PRACTICE, adding 4-second spawn protection with a blue ring, creating a dynamic in-game zone for cash rooms (, , 0) based on player count, developing a comprehensive anti-cheat system with a 3-strike permanent ban and modal, redesigning the Cash Out Successful modal for paid/free rooms (without amount/balance for free), removing players from the game immediately upon cash-out or game over, removing the intrusive mission complete popup, resolving a persistent invalid address error for deposits (via manual instructions), and constraining local practice bots to the playable area. The current task is to replace existing navigation bar squares with new intuitive icons (Home, Friends, Wallet, Settings).

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main landing page, authentication, and entry to the game. It houses game modals, skin store, and the interactive customize preview.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Verified existing Friends Invitation section in the CREATE PARTY modal.
        -   Removed INVITE FRIENDS text from the party panel (around line 4148) and a separate standalone INVITE FRIENDS panel from the main landing page background (around lines 3650-3850).
        -   Implemented a  function and applied it to all major landing page buttons (PLAY NOW, SERVER BROWSER, HOW TO PLAY, JOIN PARTY, CREATE PARTY, VIEW STORE, CHANGE SKIN, DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW), except LOCAL PRACTICE.
        -   Refactored  and  functions to include robust Privy wallet validation and initialization logic. After multiple attempts to fix a persistent invalid address error with Privy's , the solution was to bypass  entirely and display manual deposit instructions via an alert, including the user's wallet address.
        -   Removed the ü§ñ emoji from the LOCAL PRACTICE button (both desktop and mobile versions).
        -   Attempted to add a new navigation bar, then removed it as per user feedback. Currently attempting to locate and replace an existing squares navigation bar.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The core game client, rendering the game canvas, handling game logic, and in-game HUD.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Implemented 4-second spawn protection with a visible blue pulsing ring around new and respawning players/enemies. Collision detection was modified to respect this protection.
        -   Implemented a dynamic zone system in the  that adjusts the playable area radius based on real-time player count for cash game rooms (, , 0). This involved adding dynamic zone properties, helper methods for detection and calculation, updating the  method, , , , , and enemy respawn logic to use the dynamic radius.
        -   Added a comprehensive, multi-layered anti-cheat system within the , including movement validation, input pattern analysis, behavioral analysis, memory protection, and progressive penalties. A visual indicator ANTI-CHEAT ACTIVE was added to the HUD for cash games.
        -   Updated the anti-cheat system to implement a 3-strike permanent ban policy, removing previous speed reduction penalties, and integrated a dedicated full-screen CHEATING BAN modal.
        -   Redesigned the Cash Out Successful! modal to match a new visual design, incorporating time survived and eliminations stats, and conditionally hiding Amount Received and Balance sections for free/practice rooms.
        -   Updated  to track game  and trigger  upon game end or cash-out completion.
        -   Reduced in-game player and enemy speed (from 50 to 35, minimum from 0.3 to 0.2) and added movement smoothing (80% for player, 70% for enemy) to make gameplay less choppy and more fluid. Anti-cheat max speed was adjusted accordingly (8 to 6).
        -   Fixed skin synchronization:  constructor now accepts , and player rendering uses . Logic was added to retrieve the selected skin from  on game start.
        -   Revamped the in-game missions system: missions panel moved to top-center, displays one mission at a time with a 4-second cycling , and the intrusive mission complete popup that appeared over the minimap was completely removed.
        -   Implemented a critical fix to immediately remove players from the game (by setting , disabling collisions, and not rendering the player) when a GAME OVER or CASHOUT SUCCESSFUL modal appears.
        -   Fixed local practice bots: updated  to constrain bot movement and target selection to within the dynamic playable area, preventing them from moving outside boundaries.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes backend API routes.
    -   **Changes**: No new changes were explicitly documented in the trajectory for this file, although it was checked during the production infrastructure stability investigation.

- Modernizing Social Popup
- Production Infrastructure Stability: Address persistent 502/404/ERR_ABORTED errors on preview deployment for  calls.
- Locate and replace the existing squares navigation bar on the landing page with the recommended new icons (Home, Friends, Wallet, Settings).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with replacing the existing navigation bar, represented by 3 squares on the landing page, with more intuitive icons: Home (üè†), Friends (üë•), Wallet (üí∞), and Settings (‚öôÔ∏è). This update aims to align with the application's design consistency.

The engineer initially struggled to locate the existing squares navigation bar in , leading to a SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG error during file search. After the user's prompt to proceed, the engineer attempted to *add* a new navigation bar with the requested icons, as the original could not be found. However, the user clarified that the newly added navigation bar was not what was intended; the goal was to *replace* existing squares that were already part of the current UI.

Consequently, the newly added navigation bar was removed. The current state of work is that the engineer is still actively trying to pinpoint the specific code section within  that defines the squares navigation bar. Multiple search patterns (, , , , , ) have been used, but none have successfully identified the target element, leaving the task incomplete and at a standstill for location.
