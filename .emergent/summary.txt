The AI engineer's work on TurfLoot involved extensive UI/UX refinement on  and critical game mechanics adjustments in . Initially, the navigation bar was transformed from abstract squares to intuitive icons (Wallet, Friends, User Profile), with dynamic coin displays and authentication-based currency. Game-side, missions were made exclusive to paid rooms, and player movement underwent multiple iterations, ultimately settling on a constant, mass-dependent speed. Other game balance changes included increased virus spawn rates and precise mass display. A loading popup for local practice was also implemented. The current, unresolved task is a bug preventing the user profile modal from opening for authenticated users, despite the click handler correctly firing. Debugging indicates an  state, suggesting a conditional rendering issue within the modal's implementation.

The TurfLoot application is a military-themed Agar.io-style multiplayer game with Hathora servers and Privy wallet integration, focused on evolving its MVP. Initial goals included UI/UX fixes (e.g., Hold E to Cash Out bar, player visuals, mobile UI), game balancing (coin density, speed, dynamic leaderboard), adding a missions system, and upgrading the skin store. Recent work implemented from the trajectory covers:

-   **UI/UX Enhancements**: Removed redundant Invite Friends sections; implemented Privy authentication for most landing page buttons; redesigned Cash Out Successful modal; removed intrusive mission completion popups; refined landing page navigation bar (replaced squares with Wallet, Friends, User Profile icons, adjusted their order and positioning); removed emojis from LEADERBOARD, CUSTOMIZE, PARTY, and WALLET text, while preserving nav bar emojis; removed empty icon containers and left-aligned text for LEADERBOARD, WALLET, PARTY, CUSTOMIZE sections; precisely repositioned the CUSTOMIZE box.
-   **Game Mechanics**: Added 4-second spawn protection; dynamic in-game zones for cash rooms (, , 0); a comprehensive anti-cheat system with a 3-strike permanent ban; ensured players are removed post-cash-out/game over; constrained local practice bots; missions are now *only* for paid rooms (not local practice); implemented a constant speed movement system where top speed decreases with increasing size; increased virus spawn rate (from 6 to 12).
-   **Wallet/Economy**: Resolved Privy invalid address for deposits (manual instructions); wallet icon dynamically displays coin balance (0 for guests, 2,500 for authenticated).
-   **User Feedback**: Added a loading popup for LOCAL PRACTICE.
-   **Bug Fixes**: Corrected in-game mass display to show whole numbers, not decimals.

The current task is to fix a bug where the user profile popup modal, triggered by the 👤 icon, does not open for authenticated users.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the main landing page, serving as the user's entry point to the application. It handles authentication, displays primary game modals, the skin store, and customization previews, and hosts the main navigation bar.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Replaced desktop (lines 3428-3440) and mobile (lines 4626-4638) squares navigation elements with new intuitive icons (Home, Friends, Wallet, Settings).
        -   Further refined navigation: removed Home (🏠) icon, swapped Wallet (💰) and Friends (👥) positions, and replaced Settings (⚙️) with a User Profile (👤) icon, applied to both desktop and mobile views.
        -   Implemented dynamic coin display for the Wallet (💰) icon, showing a formatted  value. This involved adding a  state and a  to load/save currency from , initializing guest users with  coins and authenticated users with  coins using unique  keys ( vs ).
        -   Removed emojis (🎯, 👥, 💰) from LEADERBOARD, CUSTOMIZE, PARTY, and WALLET main UI text elements (e.g., around lines 3920, 4295, 4140, 4010).
        -   Removed empty icon container  elements associated with LEADERBOARD, WALLET, PARTY, and CUSTOMIZE sections, and adjusted their text alignment to be left-aligned, maintaining thematic colors.
        -   Adjusted the  CSS property for the CUSTOMIZE panel from an initial  to , then , , and finally  for optimal vertical positioning on the landing page (e.g., around line 4260).
        -   Integrated a loading popup for the LOCAL PRACTICE button. This involved adding  state, modifying  handlers for both desktop and mobile buttons to set  and navigate after a 500ms timeout, and adding the loading modal structure with blue tactical styling.
        -   Added debugging  statements to the  handlers of the User Profile icon to diagnose why the modal wasn't opening when authenticated.
        -   A  component was added, but its conditional rendering is under investigation.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This file contains the core game logic and rendering for the Agar.io-style gameplay, including player movement, game object generation (coins, viruses), collision detection, and in-game HUD elements.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Modified the  (around lines 87-99) that initializes missions to check if  (fee > 0 and not 'local' or 'practice' mode). Missions are now only created and displayed for cash game rooms, removed from local practice.
        -   Implemented a dynamic speed system within the  method (around lines 840-919). This system causes player speed to gradually decrease as their mass increases, using a formula like , with a defined minimum speed (e.g., 1.5 pixels/frame), to create strategic gameplay depth.
        -   Refined player movement multiple times:
            -   Initial complex smoothing, distance threshold, boundary handling, and anti-cheat interference adjustments.
            -   Simplified to an Agar.io-style direct linear movement system with 10% camera smoothing (e.g.,  in ).
            -   Further optimized for ultra-snappiness (e.g., 15% movement per frame, 20% camera interpolation).
            -   Reduced overall speed while maintaining responsiveness (e.g., 8% movement per frame).
            -   Finalized to a **constant speed of 3.5 pixels per frame** (around line 840), independent of mouse distance, incorporating distance normalization and overshoot prevention.
        -   Increased the virus spawn rate in the  method (around line 731) from 6 to 12 viruses for all game modes, enhancing game challenge.
        -   Removed the  emoji from PLAY AGAIN and the  emoji from BACK TO LOBBY buttons within the Game Over modal, cleaning up the post-game UI.
        -   Fixed a bug where player mass displayed decimal values by applying  to the  display in the in-game HUD (around line 2458).

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This file is crucial for handling all general-purpose backend API requests and routing them to appropriate handlers.
    -   **Changes Made**: No explicit changes were documented for this file in the provided trajectory.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with and actively debugging an issue where the user profile popup modal, triggered by clicking the 👤 icon in the navigation bar, was failing to open for authenticated users.

Debugging efforts involved:
1.  Adding  statements to the  handlers for both desktop and mobile versions of the user profile icon in . These logs confirmed that the click event was registered () and the modal's state was being set to  ().
2.  However, the console logs also revealed that the  state was  at the time of the click, despite the user being expected to be authenticated for this test.
3.  Subsequent UI inspections and screenshot verifications confirmed that the modal visually did not appear on the screen ().

The current assessment is that while the click handler and state update are functioning, the  component itself likely has conditional rendering logic that prevents it from being displayed if the  state is . The task ended with the AI engineer preparing to investigate this conditional rendering within the modal's definition to understand why it's not appearing for a user who should be authenticated.
