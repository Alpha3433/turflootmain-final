The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enhancing the TurfLoot application, covering UI/UX improvements, bug fixes, and feature additions across multiple iterations. Initial tasks involved refining the Cash Out modal and fixing persistent build errors. A significant portion of the work revolved around integrating Hathora for paid rooms, including dynamic entry fees, server fee deduction, and real-time server listing with latency-based sorting across various regions. The engineer also addressed UI layout issues, ensured button visibility, and tackled authentication persistence challenges. Key developments included a comprehensive loyalty system with dynamic fees, monthly resets, and various UI components, along with a significant redesign of the server browser modal. The trajectory concludes with persistent issues regarding the server browser modal not updating despite extensive debugging.

The TurfLoot application is an Agar.io-style multiplayer game with a military theme, leveraging Hathora for game servers and Privy for authentication. The core problem is to expand the MVP functionality with UI/UX improvements, bug fixes, and social features, with a strong focus on both mobile and desktop experiences.

Implemented features include:
- Refined Cash Out modal (no emojis, paste functionality).
- Debugged and fixed JSX build errors in core game components.
- Transformed a static UI element into a dynamic, real-time server selector.
- Hathora integration for paid rooms with dynamic entry fees, 10% server fee deduction, and real-time server listing sorted by latency across US, EU (Frankfurt, London), and OCE regions.
- Fixed in-game stats panel layout and ensured critical buttons (Cash Out, Split) are visible on desktop.
- Persistent authentication state for desktop modals.
- Removed üîê emoji from LOGIN buttons.
- Integrated Helius API key for wallet functionality, reducing refresh frequency.
- Implemented dynamic player counts in server browser for both paid and practice rooms.
- Resolved Hathora  method error for paid servers.
- Refined anti-cheat system thresholds to be less aggressive.
- Removed bots from paid Hathora rooms, ensuring human-only competition.
- Fixed OCE/Sydney region mapping to Hathora servers.
- Implemented a dynamic loyalty system (Bronze, Silver, Gold tiers based on games/wager) with monthly resets, carryover perks, and UI elements (Tier Badge, Progress Bar, Notifications).
- Redesigned and made minimalistic the loyalty progress bar.
- Repositioned desktop navigation buttons (SERVER BROWSER, LOCAL PRACTICE, HOW TO PLAY) and Discord button (to bottom-left with logo).
- Added dynamic, tactical HUD-style mock cash out notifications to the bottom right.
- Updated loyalty progress bar to display dynamic user stats (paid games only) and fixed display for new accounts (0/0).
- Redesigned the server browser popup modal to condense info, use stake filters, prioritize active servers, and simplify labels with region flags.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical issue where the redesigned server browser modal was not appearing on the desktop landing page, instead displaying the old design, despite extensive changes made to . The AI engineer had fully implemented the redesign (condensed server info, stake filters, active server prioritization, region flags), and debugging steps showed the new component *was* being loaded in the background, but was consistently obscured by the Privy login modal. Furthermore, even when attempts were made to bypass the login modal or force component reloads (e.g., clearing cache, renaming files), the user reported seeing the old server browser design. The AI engineer concluded the redesign was working but suspected persistent caching or an underlying issue preventing the new component from consistently rendering on the frontend.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate why the old server browser modal persists and how to force the new design to render.
