<analysis>
The previous AI engineer focused on critical bug fixes and implementing multiplayer features for the TurfLoot application. Initial efforts involved overhauling the server browser for real-time ping and region mapping, resolving API integration and MongoDB connectivity issues, and refactoring Hathora client integration. Key problems included a persistent Hathora SDK connection issue, a broken wallet functionality due to an API route issue, region mapping discrepancies, WebSocket connection failures, and an infinite UI re-render loop.

The engineer systematically addressed these by:
1. Correcting Hathora region codes and WebSocket URL formats (including authentication tokens) in  and .
2. Updating the Helius API key in .
3. Fixing a duplicate  component in  to resolve the infinite render loop.
4. Implementing a robust CDN-based ping measurement system in  to replace faulty WebSocket pings.
5. Refining server region passing in  to use specific  for Hathora.
6. Crucially, eliminating all local game fallbacks from  for server browser joins, ensuring 100% Hathora room creation with loading states and clear error messages, while preserving the Local Practice mode.

<product_requirements>
The TurfLoot application is an Agar.io-style multiplayer game with a military theme, leveraging Hathora for game servers and Privy for authentication. The core objective is to enhance MVP functionality through UI/UX improvements, bug fixes, and social features, supporting both mobile and desktop.

**Key features and fixes implemented so far:**
*   **Redesigned Server Browser**: A functional modal with condensed information, stake filters, region flags, dynamic player counts, real client-side ping (with caching, color-coding, auto-sorting), and Hathora room creation/joining. Empty servers collapse into Create New Room. Now uses CDN-based ping.
*   **Dynamic Player Counts**: Real Privy user sessions in Hathora rooms are tracked.
*   **Desktop Loading Popup**: Implemented for LOCAL PRACTICE button.
*   **Wallet Functionality**: Fixed with Helius API key integration, improved wallet detection, and display of real SOL balances post-login. Dedicated wallet balance and transactions API routes were created.
*   **Anti-cheat System**: Debugged, made lenient, and temporarily disabled for testing.
*   **In-game Fixes**: Fixed Canvas Gradient  error when interacting with viruses.
*   **Database Connectivity**: Resolved MongoDB connection issues.
*   **Hathora Integration**: Refactored for robust room creation, correct region mapping (, ), authenticated WebSocket connection (), and removal of all local server fallbacks for server browser joins. Includes loading modals and retry logic.
*   **Multiplayer Core**: WebSocket connection logic integrated into the game client for real-time multiplayer, including UI indicators for connection status and player count.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's report that multiplayer games selected on the server browser are still putting me in local games, and an observation in the console logs indicating repeated  requests to  failing with , suggesting issues with the CDN-based ping measurement implemented earlier.

The AI engineer's previous extensive work involved:
1.  **Ensuring 100% Hathora Multiplayer Rooms**: Removing all local fallback logic from the  and  functions in , and also from mobile UI sections. This was intended to force the creation of real Hathora rooms and prevent accidental local game creation, except for the explicit LOCAL PRACTICE button.
2.  **Implementing Loading State**: A CREATING HATHORA ROOM loading modal with regional targeting and an animated progress bar was added to  (with  in ) to improve user feedback during room creation.
3.  **Enhancing Error Handling**: Clear error messages were implemented for cases where Hathora room creation fails.
4.  **Parameter Validation**: Ensured correct , , and  parameters are passed to the  page and correctly interpreted to prevent local fallbacks.
5.  **Fixing Syntax Errors**: Several duplicate/unreachable code segments (e.g., duplicate error handling after  statements) were removed from  to resolve build errors.

Despite these fixes, the user's latest console logs show repeated ‚è≥ Privy bridge not yet available, waiting... messages and numerous  for CDN ping endpoints, indicating the ping system is still problematic. More critically, the user explicitly states that clicking server browser options still leads to local games. The AI engineer noted that while the server browser loads and shows simulated pings, no logs showing actual server joins, suggesting a potential frontend issue where server entries might not be clickable or the  function isn't being triggered as expected.
