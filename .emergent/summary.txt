The previous AI engineer's work on the TurfLoot application has been a highly iterative and detailed process, primarily focused on refining the in-game experience and landing page UI to match specific user requests for an Agar.io-style game. Initially, the engineer tackled a critical bug in the Hold E to Cash Out progress bar, which required careful debugging of  dependencies in . This was followed by numerous visual enhancements, including changing the cash-out bar color, adding and refining player eyes (with multiple iterations to adjust size and position), restoring and tweaking grid lines, and eliminating mass numbers from player circles.

Significant effort was also placed on mobile responsiveness and consistency, specifically fixing discrepancies on the mobile landing page. Core game mechanics were then balanced, adjusting coin spawn density to match Agar.io, increasing coin mass value, and implementing an authentic mass-based speed formula. A comprehensive missions system was introduced for in-game rewards, and the skin store was upgraded with authentic character previews, dynamic currency, and a wide array of rarity-based skins. Finally, the engineer began integrating the landing page preview with the selected skin and started work on dynamically loading live party lobbies, but encountered a slight misinterpretation regarding the invite friends feature location. The process has consistently involved rigorous screenshot-based testing and iterative refinement in direct response to user feedback, including repeated debugging of caching and scope issues in React components.

<product_requirements>
The TurfLoot application is a military-themed Agar.io-style global multiplayer game, leveraging Hathora for servers and Privy for wallet integration. The primary goal was to transform the initial MVP, fixing UI, and expanding features. Key requirements included: a complete redesign of the in-game Agario experience (engine fix, military/tactical theme, dynamic circular world, Agar.io viruses, live leaderboard, player info panel, action buttons), implementing Hold E to Cash Out with a progress bar, integrating local bot practice, fixing a broken landing page with JOIN PARTY and SERVER BROWSER modals, Privy wallet integration, and a VIEW STORE modal. Recent explicit requests involved:
1. Fixing the Hold E to Cash Out progress bar (stuck at 0%).
2. Changing the cash-out bar color to green.
3. Removing player mass numbers and adding black eyes (in-game and local bots).
4. Restoring and refining grid lines for visibility.
5. Correcting mobile landing page discrepancies (military lingo, button names).
6. Reordering mobile landing page stats and username input.
7. Increasing coin spawn density and mass value to Agar.io standards.
8. Implementing Agar.io-like speed mechanics, then adjusting overall speed.
9. Fixing the live leaderboard to show correct rankings dynamically.
10. Adding a missions system for earning coins in-game.
11. Updating the landing page customize circle preview to match the in-game character.
12. Adding interactive, mouse-following eyes animation to the landing page preview.
13. Removing Please set up your embedded wallet popups on DEPOSIT/WITHDRAW.
14. Updating skin store previews to show actual in-game characters.
15. Adding various owned and purchasable unique skins with rarities to the store.
16. Making the skin store currency dynamic and linked to missions.
17. Synchronizing equipped skins between the store and landing page preview.
18. Removing Equipped [Skin Name]! popup.
19. Replacing mock data in the JOIN PARTY modal with live lobbies.
20. Adding a friends invitation section to the CREATE PARTY modal.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main landing page, authentication, and entry point to the game. It contains the JOIN PARTY and CREATE PARTY modals, skin store, and the interactive customize preview.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive modifications. Mobile UI fixes for military lingo (OPERATIVES to PLAYERS) and button names (LEADERBOARD to SERVER BROWSER). Reordered mobile stats. Removed wallet setup popups. Redesigned skin store previews to be authentic in-game characters with eyes. Added multiple owned and purchasable skins with rarity tiers. Integrated a dynamic currency system with the skin store, resolving  by adding  state to this page. Synchronized equipped skins to update the landing page preview and persist via . Refined interactive eye positioning (distance and smoothness). Removed Equipped [Skin Name]! popup. Removed mock data from JOIN PARTY modal and integrated with live API endpoint. Currently, work is ongoing to add a friends invitation section to the CREATE PARTY modal.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The core game client. Renders game canvas, handles game logic, and in-game HUD.
    -   **Changes**: Deeply modified multiple times. Fixed Hold E to Cash Out progress bar ( dependency fix). Changed cash-out bar color to green. Removed player mass numbers and added black eyes. Adjusted  for smaller eyes. Made grid lines visible (color, ). Increased coin spawn density (from 100 to 1000) and coin value (from 1 to 5 mass). Implemented Agar.io-like speed formula () and then adjusted the base speed. Replaced hardcoded leaderboard with dynamic, real-time sorting based on game data. Implemented a comprehensive missions system with UI, progress tracking, and currency rewards.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Appears to be an alternative or test game implementation.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to remove mass numbers and add black eyes, mirroring changes in , as a safeguard, though  is primarily used for both regular and local bot games.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes backend API routes.
    -   **Changes**: Added a new GET endpoint  to fetch real-time public party lobbies from MongoDB, replacing mock data used by the frontend.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of implementing a friends invitation section within the CREATE PARTY modal on the landing page (). The user's explicit request was to add a section that allows users to invite there friends to the new lobby that will be created once the CREATE PARTY button is clicked.

The engineer successfully located the  code. However, there was a misinterpretation or error in the previous two  attempts (Chat 564, 566), resulting in the Invite Friends section being added to a withdraw-related popup or an incorrect location, rather than the intended CREATE PARTY modal. The AI acknowledged this confusion (Chat 565, 567) and the final action in the trajectory was the AI preparing to correctly add the JavaScript functionality and event listeners for the friends invitation to the  modal. This indicates the feature is currently incomplete and the UI element for inviting friends still needs to be correctly rendered within the designated modal and hooked up with its functionality.
