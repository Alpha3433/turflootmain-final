The previous AI engineer meticulously addressed a series of critical WebSocket connection issues within the TurfLoot application, transforming its multiplayer architecture to be Hathora-first. The process was iterative, involving detailed debugging and multiple code modifications across frontend and backend components. Key problems identified and resolved included mixed content security errors due to insecure WebSocket URLs, an infinite recursion bug in the WebSocket  shim, uninitialized  references, missing  parameters in WebSocket URLs, incorrect  and  variable definitions, a connection info mismatch during reconnections, and a crucial JWT token authentication mismatch between the client and the game server. Alongside these, the Helius API key was updated, fixing the wallet's balance display. Despite these extensive fixes, the user continues to report persistent WebSocket Error 1006, leading the engineer to suspect issues with the Hathora game server's status or its WebSocket path.

The TurfLoot application is an Agar.io-style, military-themed multiplayer game built on Next.js, leveraging Hathora for authoritative game servers and Privy for authentication, designed for both mobile and desktop. The core objective is a complete transition to a Hathora-based multiplayer experience, replacing mock systems. Essential features include a dynamic Server Browser displaying real-time player counts and CDN-based ping, a functional Wallet integrated with the Helius API, and robust Hathora integration for room management (creation, region mapping, authenticated WebSocket connections). All game logic must reside server-side, eliminating local server fallbacks. The strategy is Server Browser-First, listing active rooms before creating new ones. A defined Room Lifecycle ensures on-demand room creation with an 8-minute keep-alive. WebSocket transport operates at a 20 Hz tick rate, and Spectator/Party support are required. Server-side bot management for auto-fill is explicitly not needed.

- : Main landing page, initiates game sessions.
  - Changes: Refactored  for server-side room creation, updated navigation parameters.
- : Client-side game logic and WebSocket connection.
  - Changes: Reverted  to  for WebSocket URL (fixing Mixed Content). Aggressive auto-reconnect logic updated. URL update logic now correctly propagates  and  for new rooms. Ensured  parameter is included in WebSocket URL.
- : Server-side API endpoint for Hathora room creation.
  - Changes: Replaced mock logic with Hathora SDK calls. Debugged parameter passing and response handling. Added  block with retry logic. Modified to generate custom JWT tokens ( import changed from  to ) that the game server expects, instead of relying solely on Hathora SDK tokens.
- : Client-side Hathora API wrapper.
  - Changes: Updated  calls to server API route . Fixed WebSocket  shim to prevent infinite recursion (). Removed direct  SDK calls, replacing them with server API calls. Correctly defined  and  variables within  to use  data.
- : Environment variables.
  - Changes:  and  updated to .
- : Custom Hathora game server logic.
  - Changes: Modified to include  message handler. Expects tokens signed with .
- : Authentication module for the Hathora game server.
  - Changes: Defines  function using  and .

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a series of critical fixes addressing all previously identified WebSocket connection issues. The application now successfully creates Hathora rooms, generates and validates custom JWT tokens, and constructs WebSocket URLs with correct host, port, token, and  parameters. The Helius API key has also been updated, and the wallet functionality is confirmed to be working.

However, despite these comprehensive fixes, the user is still reporting persistent WebSocket Error 1006 when attempting to load into a game. The console logs provided by the user indicate that the client-side is now correctly forming the  WebSocket URL with all necessary parameters (token and roomId) and dynamically updating host/port info during reconnections. The Hathora room creation is successful, and the custom JWT tokens are being generated and validated by the backend.

The immediate problem is that the WebSocket connection to the Hathora game server continues to fail with Error 1006, suggesting an issue beyond the client-side URL construction and token generation/validation. The AI engineer's current focus is to investigate the Hathora server itself to determine if it is running correctly or if there are issues with its WebSocket path.
