The AI engineer successfully progressed the TurfLoot application from an initial state through several critical bug fixes and feature implementations. The trajectory shows a systematic approach to debugging and development. Key achievements include: resolving a 500 Server Error in the Party Lobby caused by API routing mismatches and JavaScript hoisting; correcting the in-game and lobby ping system to accurately measure Hathora latency instead of displaying a static 999ms; fixing a username display issue in the Party Lobby by cleaning stale database records and enhancing fallback logic; addressing a party game black screen issue with a frontend player spawn protection fix; and removing mock data from the server browser to implement real-time player tracking. The engineer consistently debugged, implemented solutions, and validated through backend tests and user feedback. The final issue identified is that the real-time player count in the server browser isn't updating because the session tracking API calls are not being triggered on game join.

<product_requirements>
TurfLoot, an Agar.io-style game, aims to deliver a global multiplayer experience. Core requirements include Hathora integration for global servers (OCE, US, Europe), focusing on pure player-vs-player gameplay with no bots. Essential features include a Party Lobby (create/invite, 2-player cap, owner room selection, persistent state, mobile optimization), dynamic leaderboards, and a wallet balance display via Privy. Real-time, accurate latency display to Hathora servers is crucial. UI/UX was to be improved with resized popups and synchronized social features. Previous issues involved 502/404/ERR_ABORTED errors, a fixed  button, and synchronized friend systems. Spectator mode was removed. The PRACTICE WITH BOTS mode was converted to a global server. The current focus is on refining party and multiplayer features for stability and real-time accuracy.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing an issue where the Server Browser on a second device was not updating the player count in real-time, even after a player had joined a game on the first device. This indicates a problem with the client-side mechanism for updating player counts. The engineer had previously implemented backend APIs (, ) and integrated them into the  for session tracking, and confirmed the backend works with manual session creation. The  component's auto-refresh interval was also reduced to 3 seconds. However, console logs from the user indicated that the session tracking API calls () were still not being triggered when a user joins a game. The current hypothesis is that the session tracking code in  is not executing correctly due to issues with  or  being undefined, or the socket connection not correctly triggering the tracking.

<optional_next_step>
Add more robust session tracking in  to ensure the API calls are made consistently.
