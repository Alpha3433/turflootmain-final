The trajectory details the development of TurfLoot, an Agar.io-style game, by an AI engineer. The initial phase focused on fixing a critical Next.js build error () in  that blocked all development. After multiple attempts and calling the  several times, the root cause was identified as an extra closing brace at line 2478, which, once removed, resolved the build and runtime errors.

Post-fix, the engineer implemented numerous mobile UI/UX improvements, including removing cluttering text, repositioning buttons for better ergonomics, and enhancing collision detection. The split cell merge timing was adjusted to match classic Agar.io. Backend logic for paid rooms (, , 0 tiers) was fully implemented, and existing UI enhancements were integrated into these paid rooms. The mission reward system was refined to ensure real-time balance updates across the UI. Finally, significant effort was dedicated to resolving persistent deployment-related build errors, primarily related to WalletConnect dependencies and Next.js configuration for production, and then fixing a subsequent black screen issue on the app preview. The current work involves optimizing the mobile customization screen layout.

TurfLoot, an Agar.io-style real-time multiplayer game, required mobile optimization and feature expansion. Initial goals included functional mobile joysticks, action buttons, dynamic minimap, mobile stat/leaderboard panels, and an orientation gate. The project focused on mobile UI refinements, an enhanced player experience (waged balance, mission tracking fixes), a comprehensive customization overhaul (mobile-friendly modal, skin management, removal of Hats), and integration of an in-game economy with persistent coin rewards. Core game mechanics were adjusted, including increased virus count, player speed tuning, and the full implementation of the Agar.io-style Split mechanic (up to 16 cells, 10s cooldown, 15s merge lock). A modern Game Over popup was also designed. Key tasks accomplished during this trajectory were: enabling individual split cells to collect orbs, cleaning up the mobile in-game UI (removing text overlays, repositioning buttons), adjusting split cell merge timing to 8 seconds, making mock data popups realistic for paid lobbies (, , 0, 0, 00), making the cash out button gold with a progress ring, implementing comprehensive backend logic for paid rooms, applying all free room UI/game logic to paid rooms, and ensuring mission reward balance updates sync across the navigation bar and customization modal.

        -   Game logic enhancements: Added enhanced virus/spike detection for split cells and mobile users, and player detection for split cells eating other players.
        -   Adjusted  from 15s/12s to 8s for faster split cell merging.
        -   Adjusted in-game mock data (, , ) to be more realistic.
        -   Styled mobile cash out button to be gold with a green progress ring animation on hold.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on optimizing the mobile customization screen. The user provided a screenshot showing the current mobile customization screen, highlighting issues like hard-to-read text, poor layout, cramped elements, small touch targets, and inefficient use of screen space.

The AI engineer's approach involves modifying  to implement a mobile-optimized version. This includes using responsive design to switch between desktop and mobile layouts. The engineer started by modifying the structure, initially encountering a build error due to leftover code from the original file. This syntax error was then identified and cleaned up. The last action was successfully cleaning up the file syntax. The goal is to make the customization modal user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing on mobile devices while keeping the desktop version untouched.
