The trajectory details several development cycles for a multiplayer game. Initially, a critical split mechanic in TurfLoot Arena was refactored from client-side to server-authoritative Colyseus logic, focusing on  and . This was followed by implementing a custom game-over screen. The bulk of the trajectory, however, involved extensive debugging and iterative refactoring of the paid room entry fee deduction system using Privy and Solana. This process was plagued by persistent issues related to Privy's embedded wallet not exposing signing capabilities to its React hooks (e.g.,  returning empty arrays,  being undefined), complicated by Next.js SSR problems and incorrect API usage according to Privy's evolving documentation. Multiple attempts to reconfigure Privy and adjust signing logic failed, leading to a call to the .

The primary objective is to make the multiplayer TurfLoot Arena mode's split mechanic functionally identical to the single-player  practice mode. When a player presses the spacebar, their character (a circular cell) should divide in half. The original cell's mass must be correctly distributed among the new, smaller pieces, which are then propelled forward. This must be server-authoritative, stable, and not cause disconnections. The previous implementation was flawed, creating projectiles without actual splitting.

Additionally, a custom game-over screen (using a provided image) must appear when a player dies in arena mode.

Furthermore, a robust fee deduction system for paid arena rooms needs to be implemented. When a signed-in Privy user joins a paid room, they should be charged the equivalent Solana amount. This transaction must be handled entirely via Privy and Helius, adhering to official documentation, without any fallbacks. The system also requires migration to Privy 3.0 standards and proper handling of embedded wallets.

- **Fix Privy Embedded Wallet Signing**: The most critical pending task is to resolve the persistent issue where Privy's embedded wallet fails to sign Solana transactions, consistently reporting No embedded or connected wallet found for address.
- **Verify Split Mechanic Gameplay**: Although implemented, the end-to-end functionality of the server-authoritative split mechanic has not been verified in actual gameplay.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently focused on resolving the error Failed to process room entry fee: Transaction failed: No embedded or connected wallet found for address. This error occurs when attempting to join a paid room, indicating that Privy's  hook cannot properly access the connected embedded Solana wallet.

Debugging attempts involved:
1.  Verifying and updating the Privy 3.0 configuration in  to ensure , , and  are correctly set for embedded wallet detection.
2.  Ensuring necessary React hooks like  and  are correctly imported and used in  to avoid build errors.
3.  Adding extensive console logging in  and  to trace wallet resolution and signing function calls.
4.  The logs (Chat 473) consistently show  from , despite a valid Solana wallet being present in . The  hook is then unable to find a wallet to process the transaction.

Recognizing the iterative failures and lack of clear progress, the AI engineer has invoked the  to seek a new strategy for this specific Privy embedded wallet signing problem.
