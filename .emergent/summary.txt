The AI engineer's work during this trajectory focused on debugging and enhancing the mobile experience of the TurfLoot game. The primary challenge involved a persistent bug where mobile-specific UI elements (minimap size, dynamic zoom, mission tracking) failed to apply on the initial game load, only appearing correctly after a play again or tab switch. This was diagnosed as a race condition between mobile device detection and game initialization. The solution involved introducing a  state flag to ensure game initialization waits for mobile detection. Additionally, the dynamic zoom intensity was reduced, and the Eliminated by... and Tab Closed popups were redesigned for better mobile readability. Finally, the mobile minimap size was iteratively increased based on user requests, from an initial 25px to 43.75px (75% increase), and then to 87.5px (another 100% increase), with all changes rigorously verified via screenshots and console logs.

<product_requirements>
TurfLoot is an Agario-style real-time multiplayer game integrating Solana and Privy.io, requiring a highly optimized mobile experience without compromising desktop functionality. The initial product vision included functional mobile joysticks, action buttons, toast-style mission notifications, a circular/collapsible minimap, mobile-specific stat/leaderboard panels, removal of Ping/FPS, auto-hiding instructions, iOS safe area support, and an orientation gate. The mobile lobby system and Privy authentication also needed condensation and fixing respectively.

Work completed before this trajectory included fixing the mobile joystick, repositioning UI elements (trophy, cash-out, minimap), decluttering the UI (removing info emoji, multiplayer status, mission icon toggle, Mission Failed! text), redesigning popups, optimizing mission display, and implementing dynamic camera zoom for mobile.

The current trajectory addressed a critical bug where mobile-specific features (minimap, dynamic zoom, mission tracking) were not applying on the first game load. User requests included: fixing this initialization bug, making the dynamic zoom less intensive, redesigning the Eliminated by... and Tab Closed popups for clearer display of earnings, position, and mass, and subsequently increasing the minimap size twice (by 75% then 100%).

    -   **Summary**: The primary in-game component responsible for game logic, canvas rendering, and all real-time UI/UX interactions. This file was the central focus of all modifications.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Initialization Fixes**: Introduced  state to manage the asynchronous mobile detection. Modified  hooks to ensure game initialization () and subsequent game loop logic (camera zoom, minimap sizing) correctly wait for and apply mobile-specific settings on the first load.
        -   **Dynamic Zoom**: Adjusted the  function for mobile to make the zoom changes less aggressive (e.g., small players 1.05x, medium 0.8-1.0x, large 0.4-0.6x). Ensured the game's camera initialization and the game loop correctly reference the mobile state.
        -   **Popup Redesign**: Modified the rendering of Eliminated by... and Tab Closed popups to compactly display player statistics (earnings, position, mass) for a better mobile experience.
        -   **Minimap Sizing**: Initially set at 25px diameter, the mobile minimap size was first increased by 75% to 43.75px, and then by another 100% to 87.5px, dynamically based on the mobile game state.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed a critical mobile initialization bug in . Previously, mobile-specific features like dynamic zoom, minimap sizing, and mission tracking were not applied on the first game load, only after a play again event. This was identified as a race condition where the  state was not fully determined before the game  function or game loop executed.

The fix involved:
1.  **Introducing  state**: A  hook was added to track when mobile detection was definitively finalized.
2.  **Synchronizing  hooks**: The  responsible for mobile detection was modified to set  to  upon completion. The  that triggers  was then made dependent on , ensuring it only runs after mobile detection is complete.
3.  **Adjusting Zoom Intensity**: The dynamic camera zoom logic was revised to be less aggressive, providing a smoother experience (e.g., small players 1.05x zoom, large players 0.4-0.6x).
4.  **Refining Popup Designs**: The Eliminated by... and Tab Closed popups were enhanced to better display , , and  in a compact, mobile-friendly format.
5.  **Minimap Size Adjustments**: Based on user feedback, the mobile minimap size was first increased by 75% (from 25px to 43.75px), and then by another 100% (to 87.5px), making it significantly more usable.
6.  **Ensuring Consistency**: The  object now stores the  state, which is consistently referenced by the camera initialization, dynamic zoom logic, and minimap rendering sections to ensure all mobile optimizations are applied correctly from the start.

All these changes were confirmed to be working correctly on the first game load in landscape mobile mode through console logs and screenshots, indicating a complete resolution of the initial bug and successful implementation of the requested UI refinements.
