The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the TurfLoot application, primarily focusing on stabilizing and expanding the Party Lobby system. Initial efforts involved resolving recurring frontend runtime errors (e.g.,  initialization, ,  undefined variables) that resulted in black screens, often claiming success despite persistent visual issues. The engineer then tackled UI/UX improvements for the Party Lobby modal: fixing cutoff, repositioning it to the far right, and ensuring the Invite Friends functionality transforms the modal content instead of opening a separate, interfering box. A significant backend fix addressed inconsistent user ID handling in party invitations. Later, core game logic was added, including balance checking for paid rooms, enforcing a 2-player limit, and implementing a robust party matchmaking system that auto-joins members to the same game instance. The final task addressed mobile responsiveness, redesigning the Party Lobby as a less intrusive bottom sheet, optimized for both portrait and landscape views. The recurring black screen during frontend tests remains an unaddressed visual problem throughout the trajectory.

TurfLoot is an Agar.io-style multiplayer online game with core mechanics, minimap, stats, leaderboards, and a persistent username system. The application faced  errors for  routes, necessitating bypass endpoints. The social system was re-architected for robust friend management including requests, blocking, searching, and real-time presence.

The most recent overarching requirement was the Party Lobby system. Users should create parties, invite friends, and upon acceptance, the party owner should be able to join any game room, with all party members automatically following into that room. This system needed to:
- Be a general party lobby, not room-specific.
- Coordinate game joining for all party members to the same instance.
- Implement balance checking for all party members before joining paid rooms.
- Enforce a 2-player maximum cap for all lobbies.
- Restrict game room selection to only the party owner.
- Maintain party state and display it correctly upon browser refresh.
- Provide a non-intrusive, optimized mobile experience (bottom sheet, responsive to portrait/landscape).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the **redesign of the Party Lobby modal for mobile devices**. The user explicitly requested that the mobile experience be less intrusive and optimized for both portrait and landscape mobile views, without altering the desktop experience.

The AI engineer implemented a **responsive design system** within . For desktop (md+ breakpoints), the existing right-aligned modal is preserved. For mobile devices (< md breakpoints), a **bottom sheet design** was implemented, which slides up from the bottom of the screen. This bottom sheet is optimized for different mobile orientations:  for a 2x2 room button layout and  for a 4x1 horizontal room layout.

Mobile-specific UI elements such as a drag handle, compact headers, touch-friendly buttons, reduced spacing, and simplified indicators were also integrated. The solution leverages Tailwind CSS for responsive breakpoints and styling, aiming for a native feel and efficient use of mobile screen real estate. The implementation was confirmed with screenshots (albeit still showing a black screen, but confirming the structural changes) and a detailed summary of the applied mobile optimizations was provided.
