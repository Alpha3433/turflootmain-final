The AI engineer has significantly advanced the TurfLoot Arena application, primarily focusing on its Solana-based paid room entry system via Privy embedded wallets. Initial efforts concentrated on resolving a persistent /bin/bash.00 SOL balance display on the landing page, which involved debugging Helius RPC integration and environment variable caching. Following this, a crucial Solana rent-exempt minimum issue, causing transaction failures, was identified and fixed by adjusting transaction logic and balance calculations. The project then expanded to implement user-requested features: dynamic cash-out value based on eliminations, a server-side cash-out mechanism with a 10% platform fee, and a visual money indicator/leaderboard displaying real USD values in paid arenas. The AI also addressed UI issues, such as hardcoded stake amounts and preventing unwanted popups for unauthenticated users. The current task involves diagnosing and fixing stuttering player movement in the paid arena mode, marking the transition from core monetization mechanics to gameplay experience refinement.

The TurfLoot Arena application aims to provide a multiplayer gaming experience with a key monetization feature: paid room entry fees using Solana and Privy's embedded wallets, integrated with Helius RPC. Players enter rooms by paying a SOL fee, which is automatically transferred to a platform wallet. Initially, room costs were /bin/bash.02, /bin/bash.05, /bin/bash.10, later updated to /bin/bash.02, /bin/bash.50, /bin/bash.65.

The core problem addressed was the landing page incorrectly displaying /bin/bash.00 SOL even when authenticated users had funds in their Privy wallet. A Solana-specific issue where transactions failed due to insufficient funds for rent (leaving below the rent-exempt minimum) was also a critical fix.

New feature requests included:
1.  Displaying a money indicator above players' heads in paid arenas, showing their initial SOL entry fee in USD, incrementally increasing as they eliminate other players (adding the eliminated player's cash-out value).
2.  Implementing a server-side cash-out mechanic where 10% of a user's accumulated cash-out value is taken as a platform fee, and the remaining 90% is sent from the server wallet to the user's Privy embedded wallet.
3.  Ensuring the in-game leaderboard and cash-out button reflect these real USD money values (derived from the SOL entry fee), rather than in-game coin scores.
4.  Preventing any popup modals from appearing for unauthenticated users on the landing page, except for the Privy login modal.
5.  Addressing and fixing stuttery and choppy player movement in the paid arena mode.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's explicit request to review and fix the stuttery and choppy movement in the  paid arena game mode. The AI had just begun its investigation by searching  for patterns related to client-side movement and state updates, specifically , , , , and . The goal is to identify and resolve the underlying cause of the jerky movement for players within the paid game environment. All previous tasks related to balance display, transaction errors, room fee updates, cash-out mechanics, and UI rendering of money values have been addressed and are presumed to be in a functional state based on the trajectory.
