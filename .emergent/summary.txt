The provided trajectory details an extensive development effort by an AI engineer on the TurfLoot application. Initially, the focus was on completing Hathora integration, which involved updating the UI to reflect global multiplayer status, enabling global matchmaking, and crucially, systematically removing all bot logic from the game to facilitate a pure player-versus-player experience. A significant part of the work involved enhancing the in-game and lobby ping systems to dynamically measure and display real-time latency to Hathoraâ€™s global servers. UI/UX improvements included resizing large popups (Settings, Social Hub) for better screen real estate. Key bug fixes addressed navigation issues with the JOIN GLOBAL MULTIPLAYER button and synchronized the disparate friend systems. The trajectory concluded with the engineer actively diagnosing a 500 Server Error encountered when accessing the Party Lobby, specifically investigating API routing for party-related endpoints.

<product_requirements>
TurfLoot, an Agar.io-style game, aims to provide a global multiplayer experience. Initial requirements included fixing  errors, improving a social system, and implementing a Party Lobby (create/invite, 2-player cap, owner room selection, persistent state, mobile optimization). A core feature was Spectator Mode with advanced camera controls, which evolved through simplified auto-spectate and ultimately was completely removed. The PRACTICE WITH BOTS mode transitioned from a local experience to a persistent, always-on global server for multiple devices, with immediate bot/coin visibility. Dynamic leaderboard (by eliminations) and wallet balance (by Privy Ethereum balance) were also requested. The overarching goal was to host global multiplayer servers for TurfLoot across OCE, US, and Europe regions using Hathora, with a strong emphasis on pure player-vs-player gameplay without bots, accurate real-time latency display, and synchronized social features.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively investigating a 500 Server Error that occurred when the user clicked the Party Lobby navigation bar button. The engineer confirmed the  service was running and checked supervisor logs for errors, but none were immediately apparent. Initial API calls to  (via ) resulted in an Invalid action error. Further investigation involved searching for the  implementation, which revealed the existence of a separate  file. The current hypothesis is that the issue lies with the main API route not having the  routing properly configured or that there's a problem with the middleware's handling of these routes.
