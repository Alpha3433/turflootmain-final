The AI engineer's work on TurfLoot Arena progressed from foundational fixes to extensive feature development. Initially,  errors (Temporal Dead Zone for ) and RPC balance display issues (Helius API key) were resolved. Core features included implementing the 10% platform fee for paid arena entry by modifying , dynamic in-game cash-out values and their UI representation (USD above player, username below), and a server-side cash-out mechanism via . Significant effort was made to sync client-side game state with the Colyseus Cloud server due to deployment limitations, particularly for player  and . Later, UI refinements for latency meter, username/balance displays, and split cell rendering were completed. New features included a client-side elimination-based balance tracking system, a dynamic loyalty progress bar on the landing page (updating post-game via ), a Request a Feature system with Airtable integration (), and a responsive character eye-tracking. Gameplay enhancements involved a visual cooldown for the split button and spawn protection in paid arenas. The cash-out flow was integrated with Privy's native transaction UI after resolving multiple errors related to wallet detection and transaction serialization. Mission completion persistence via  and 10x skin price increases were also handled. The most recent task involved ensuring the game loading modal () appears immediately on game join, and the current issue is that this modal is getting stuck.

<product_requirements>
The TurfLoot Arena application offers a multiplayer gaming experience with Solana-based paid room entries using Privy embedded wallets and Helius RPC. Users pay a SOL fee (initially /bin/bash.02//bin/bash.05//bin/bash.10, updated to /bin/bash.02//bin/bash.50//bin/bash.65) to enter arenas. Key problems addressed were /bin/bash.00 SOL balance display and Solana rent-exempt transaction failures.
New feature implementations included:
1.  **In-game UI**: Displaying dynamic USD money indicators above players (initial fee - 10%, increasing on eliminations), and player usernames below avatars in paid arenas. Leaderboards and cash-out buttons reflect these USD values.
2.  **Cash-out Mechanism**: Server-side processing (via ) deducts 10% platform fee, sending 90% from platform wallet to user's Privy embedded wallet. The modal was redesigned to match local practice, show live balance, and integrate Privy's native transaction UI.
3.  **Client Experience**: Fixing stuttery player movement, adjusting latency meter position, preventing UI popups for unauthenticated users, ensuring consistent landing page bars during Privy login, responsive character eye tracking in customization.
4.  **Game Mechanics**: Implementing a 5-second visual cooldown for the split button and a 5-second chopped blue spawn protection border in paid arenas.
5.  **Persistence/Tracking**: Dynamic loyalty bar on landing page showing X/50 games â€¢ /00 wagered based on *completed* paid arena games (via ). Landing page leaderboard displays top earners from paid arena eliminations (via ).
6.  **User Onboarding**: Mandating custom username before game entry.
7.  **Feature Request System**: Adding a Request a Feature button/modal on landing page, categories, text input, with data saved to Airtable (via ).
8.  **Store Updates**: Increasing all paid skin prices by 10x.
9.  **Loading Experience**: Displaying a Joining Game loading modal immediately upon clicking join.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's report that the game's loading screen gets stuck in the paid arena mode, despite console logs showing the user has successfully entered the game. The user provided an image showing the stuck loading screen. The AI had just identified the problem: The loading popup is not being dismissed when the game loads. The AI's current action is to find where the popup should be closed and fix it and is about to check the dismissal logic for the  function, likely within  or . All previous tasks, including UI enhancements, payment flows, game logic, and external integrations, are presumed completed based on the conversation trajectory. The core issue is preventing users from seeing the game after successful loading.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate  dismissal logic in  and add a mechanism to close it when the game is fully loaded.
