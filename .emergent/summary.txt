The AI engineer's trajectory centered on migrating the TurfLoot game to a Hathora-first multiplayer architecture. Initial efforts resolved a  error and integrated Helius API. The first major hurdle was a  connection failure due to  parameter being 'true' and later a mixed content error ( vs ) plus a 422 Hathora API error, all resolved by direct  WebSocket implementation and updated region codes.

Subsequently, the user requested critical refactoring: switching to / APIs, returning plain room IDs, and fixing module resolution. These were implemented, leading to the discovery that the *wrong Hathora SDK* was being used. This was corrected. The final architectural shift involved moving all Hathora SDK operations to a *server-side API route* () for security. This resulted in a Zod validation error (), which the AI engineer temporarily bypassed by implementing a *mock room creation API*. The immediate task concludes with a working mock room system, but the real Hathora SDK integration issue remains to be fixed.

<product_requirements>
The TurfLoot application is an Agar.io-style military-themed multiplayer game built with Hathora for game servers and Privy for authentication, targeting both mobile and desktop. The core objective is to transition the MVP into a fully authoritative Hathora-based multiplayer experience. Implemented features include a redesigned Server Browser with dynamic player counts and CDN-based ping, fixed Wallet Functionality via Helius API, and robust Hathora Integration for room creation, region mapping, and authenticated WebSocket connections, removing local server fallbacks. Current overhaul requires all game logic to be server-side, a Server Browser-First approach (listing active, pre-warmed rooms, then creating new), defined Room Lifecycle (on-demand creation, 8-minute keep-alive), WebSocket transport at 20 Hz tick rate, and Spectator & Party support with Hathora Console monitoring. Server-side bot management for auto-fill is not required.

<code_architecture>

- : Main landing page, orchestrates user entry into game.
  - **Changes**: Refactored  to call the new server API endpoint (). Updated navigation to pass , , , , and  as URL parameters from the server API response.
- : Manages in-game experience and WebSocket connections.
  - **Changes**: Refactored WebSocket connection logic to directly use , , and  extracted from URL parameters. Removed old SDK-based connection logic and hardcoded  fallbacks. Added logic to gracefully handle  by not attempting WebSocket connections.
- : **NEW** Server-side API endpoint for Hathora room creation and connection info.
  - **Changes**: Implements a *temporary mock room creation logic* that returns a fixed , , , , and . This bypasses a Zod validation error currently encountered with the actual  calls.
- : Hathora SDK wrapper, now acts as a client-side API facade.
  - **Changes**: Removed direct Hathora SDK instantiation. All room creation and connection info requests (, ) now make  calls to the new server API route () instead of directly interacting with the SDK. Module import path updated to .
- : General API route.
  - **Changes**: Updated logic to correctly handle Hathora client methods returning plain room ID strings instead of objects with  properties.
- : Environment variables.
  - **Changes**: , ,  were updated.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing a critical issue where the server-side API route for Hathora room creation () was failing due to Zod validation errors within the  when attempting to call . To unblock the development and allow other functionalities to be tested, a **temporary mock room creation system** has been implemented.

This mock implementation in  now returns a predefined successful response including a mock  (e.g., ),  (), , and , along with an  flag.

The client-side  now calls this mock server API.  has been updated to pass the mock room details and  flag as URL parameters during navigation. Consequently,  has been refactored to consume these URL parameters and, specifically for mock rooms, to gracefully skip attempting a real WebSocket connection to . This ensures the application flow proceeds without encountering the SDK validation error.
