The AI engineer's work focused on migrating TurfLoot to a Hathora-first multiplayer architecture. This involved iteratively debugging and fixing the  integration in the server-side API route (). Initial challenges included resolving SDK import errors, correcting parameter structures for , , and  calls, and handling nested response objects. The WebSocket connection was then a major hurdle, with issues like  in the URL path and incorrect WebSocket endpoint format ( instead of ). After numerous fixes, including retry logic for , the client-side Hathora integration and WebSocket URL construction were confirmed working. The root cause for persistent  was identified as the absence of actual game server code deployed to Hathora to handle WebSocket connections. The current task is to deploy this missing game server code. The Helius API key was also updated, successfully resolving the wallet display issue.

The TurfLoot application aims to be an Agar.io-style, military-themed multiplayer game built using Hathora for game servers and Privy for authentication, supporting both mobile and desktop. The main goal is to fully transition the MVP to an authoritative Hathora-based multiplayer experience. This includes a redesigned Server Browser showing dynamic player counts and CDN-based ping, functional Wallet via Helius API, and robust Hathora integration for room creation, region mapping, and authenticated WebSocket connections, eliminating local server fallbacks. All game logic must be server-side, with a Server Browser-First approach (listing active rooms, then creating new ones), a defined Room Lifecycle (on-demand creation, 8-minute keep-alive), and WebSocket transport at a 20 Hz tick rate. Spectator and Party support with Hathora Console monitoring are also required, but server-side bot management for auto-fill is not. The existing implementation included a mock room system that has since been replaced by real Hathora SDK integration.

<code_architecture>

- : Main landing page responsible for user interaction, server browsing, and initiating game sessions.
  - **Changes**: Refactored  to call . Updated navigation to pass , , , , and  as URL parameters from the server API response. Integrated Helius API key for wallet functionality. Contains the  and  functions.
- : Client-side game page handling WebSocket connections and in-game logic.
  - **Changes**: Refactored WebSocket connection logic to directly use , , and  extracted from URL parameters. Removed old SDK-based connection logic. Modified WebSocket URL to use  endpoint and  as a query parameter. Fixed an issue where  was being incorrectly assigned the entire room response object instead of just the string . Contains critical redirect logic if game parameters are invalid.
- : Server-side API endpoint for Hathora room creation and connection information.
  - **Changes**: Replaced temporary mock room creation logic with real  calls. Implemented correct SDK usage for  client, , , and . Debugged and fixed various parameter passing and response extraction issues, including extracting  and  from . Implemented retry logic for  due to potential timing issues.
- : Client-side Hathora API wrapper.
  - **Changes**: Removed direct Hathora SDK instantiation. All room creation and connection info requests (, , ) now make  calls to the new server API route () instead of directly interacting with the SDK. Updated to return the full room info object to the client, requiring client-side extraction of specific properties like .
- : Environment variables.
  - **Changes**: , ,  were updated.  and  are critical for Hathora SDK integration.
- : The new server browser modal.
  - **Changes**: Initiates the  which ultimately calls  in .
- : **NEW** Directory for the Hathora game server.
  - **Files created**: , , , , . These files establish the structure for deploying a custom game server to Hathora Cloud to handle WebSocket connections and game logic.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully integrated the real Hathora SDK, replacing a mock room system. This involved extensive debugging of API calls, parameter structures, and response parsing for , , and  within . The wallet display issue was resolved by updating the Helius API key in the  file and confirming its visibility on the client side.

Subsequently, the focus shifted to persistent WebSocket connection errors (Error 1006) in . Initial problems included  appearing in the WebSocket URL, which was traced to incorrect  extraction from the  response in  and in the navigation URL construction in . The WebSocket URL format was also corrected to use the  endpoint as per Hathora documentation, instead of embedding the  in the path. Retry logic was added for  to handle timing issues.

All client-side and API integration issues are now resolved, with the application successfully creating real Hathora rooms, authenticating players, and constructing correct WebSocket URLs. However, the WebSocket connections continue to fail with Error 1006 because there is no actual game server code deployed to the Hathora instances to listen for and handle these WebSocket connections.

The current work involves addressing this root cause by deploying a proper game server to Hathora. The AI engineer has just completed creating the necessary game server structure, including , , , , and  within a new  directory, in preparation for local testing and subsequent deployment.

Test the newly created game server code locally to ensure it functions as expected before proceeding with Hathora deployment.
