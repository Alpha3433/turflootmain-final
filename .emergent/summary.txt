The AI engineer's work primarily revolved around enhancing the TurfLoot game, an Agario-style multiplayer application. The initial phase focused on mobile responsiveness, UI/UX refinements, and an extensive overhaul of the customization system, removing Hats and Upgrade Rarity features, and integrating a new  component. An in-game economy was introduced, linking mission rewards to a persistent coin balance displayed on the landing page. Core game mechanics were adjusted, like virus count and player speed, and the lobby system was removed.

The bulk of the recent work, spanning a significant portion of the trajectory, concentrated on implementing the comprehensive Split mechanic, a core Agar.io feature. This involved numerous iterations of debugging and refinement, addressing issues such as  variable scope, player  coordinates, incorrect mass synchronization for split eligibility, display of multiple cells post-split, cell movement following the mouse, and fine-tuning merge logic and split distance for classic Agar.io clustering. The split feature now includes a desktop button with a 10-second cooldown and dynamic visual states. The game over popup was also redesigned for a modern look. The current task involves ensuring split cells can collect orbs independently.

TurfLoot, an Agario-style real-time multiplayer game, required substantial mobile optimization and feature expansion from its MVP state. User requirements included functional mobile joysticks, action buttons, mission notifications, a dynamic minimap, mobile stat/leaderboard panels, and an orientation gate. The trajectory focused on:

1.  **Mobile UI Enhancements**: Refined dynamic zoom, redesigned popups, iterative minimap adjustments, and ensuring correct mobile feature loading.
2.  **Player Experience**: Displaying waged balance, removing kill feeds, and fixing mission tracking race conditions.
3.  **Customization Overhaul**: Mobile-friendly Change Appearance modal, skin management (adding/removing specific skins, setting defaults), complete removal of Hats category and upgrade rarity.
4.  **In-Game Economy**: Adjusted mission rewards (e.g., 900 coins for Eliminate) with persistence to player accounts, a dynamic coin display on the landing page, and new accounts starting at zero coins.
5.  **Core Game Mechanics**: Removal of the Lobby System, increased green spikes/viruses, lowered player movement speed, and a fix for a mobile leaderboard error.
6.  **Agar.io-style Split Mechanic**: Full implementation for desktop and mobile, covering configuration, state, player cell structure, input handling, max cells (16), 10-second cooldown, 15-second merge lock, and visual clustering behavior.
7.  **Game Over Popup Redesign**: Modern, sleek design for the Left Game popup.
8.  **Speed Adjustments**: Increased initial speed for small circles and a slight overall speed boost for bigger circles.
9.  **Split Cell Orb Collection**: Individual split cells should be able to collect orbs and increase their mass.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on enabling individual split cells to collect orbs (golden $ circles) and increase their mass, a core Agar.io mechanic. This involved modifying the orb collection logic in .

The AI engineer identified that the  logic was only checking , and needed to iterate through each individual cell within the player's  array to allow independent orb collection.

The specific change made was to modify the orb collection logic (around line 2336 in ) to ensure that  includes not just , but also  if the player has multiple cells. This would allow each cell to independently detect and collect orbs.

The last action recorded was an attempt to take a screenshot after making this change to verify the functionality. However, this screenshot attempt failed to capture the in-game state, instead showing the Game Ended popup because the player was eliminated before the feature could be properly demonstrated.
