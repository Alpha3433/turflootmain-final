The previous AI engineer meticulously refined the TurfLoot application, focusing heavily on user interface and experience. Initially, the engineer debugged a critical Privy.io  integration issue, correctly identifying it as an external configuration problem rather than a code defect, guiding the user on the required Privy dashboard changes.

Subsequently, a significant portion of work centered on enhancing and redesigning the cash-out workflow and its modal. This involved multiple iterations of design updates to achieve pixel-perfect alignment, size, and aesthetic matching user-provided screenshots, utilizing React Portals for proper modal centering.

Further efforts included extensive layout adjustments on the main page to resolve element cutoff issues, iterative logo replacements across the navbar and login modal, and a complete redesign of in-game virus/spike visuals to align with a new geometric aesthetic. The engineer concluded by initiating a swap of the in-game stats box and minimap positions, demonstrating a commitment to detailed UI/UX improvements.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on highly granular UI/UX improvements based on direct user feedback.

The most recent completed tasks involved:
1.  **Brand Logo Consistency**: After several iterations, the correct cheerful sun logo with teal eyes and smile was finally successfully integrated and verified across both the main navbar () and the login modal (), replacing all old logo instances and CSS-drawn characters. This ensured consistent branding throughout the user's journey.
2.  **Navbar Icon Redesign**: The speaker icon was removed from the navbar. The profile and settings gear icons were completely redesigned to be more modern, minimalistic, and visually cohesive (). This included removing heavy gradients and shadows, using smaller icons, subtle backgrounds, and simplified hover effects.
3.  **In-Game Spike Redesign**: The visual appearance of the in-game virus/spikes in  was dramatically overhauled. They were transformed from simple lines into striking geometric star designs with bright green centers, cyan tips, gradient fills, outer glows, and subtle pulsing animations, aligning with the new brand aesthetic.
4.  **UI Element Position Swap**: The very last task initiated was to swap the positions of the You stats box (Net Worth, K/D, Streak) and the minimap within the  game interface. The stats box was originally  and the minimap was . The engineer was in the process of swapping these to place the minimap  and the stats box . This task was in progress at the very end of the trajectory.
